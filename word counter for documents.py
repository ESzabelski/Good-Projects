adict=word_count("""Ryla was humming to herself, happy despite the desolation outside, staring out of the thick window at the small energy fields fighting in desperation to keep the paths clear against the extreme amounts of snow from last night.  In contrast the sun was out, giving the frosted landscape a nice aesthetic touch to the otherwise bleak desolation.  She sighed.  She did not like the cold, the snow, or dark so perhaps this was a very bad place for her but these kinds of mornings gave her a sort of strength to remain joyful.
Her main job was head of communications – which might seem strange given her slightly introverted nature, but her shyness never interfered with her duties – but she was also trained in flying aerial vehicles.  She was learning how to fly the Gyro-Copter from Feyria since things pretty slow on Reiko-10 at the moment.  Today would be perfect to practice some more since the weather was supposed to be clear for the first half of the day.  If she could only pull Feyria away from the guys… Yeah that sounded like a plan.  Feyria was amazing at flying and would gladly help Ryla further.  Ryla went to turn to leave her slight daydream when she felt a claw dig into her right shoulder.
“Look out behind you!” a harsh, dark voice yelled at the same time.
Ryla’s eyes went wide, her heart quickened and she jumped back, hitting the wall she was just looking out of and faced towards what was behind her.
It was a grinning man with wild, slightly medium length hair, his teeth under the smile nearly covering the entire length of his mouth in the wide laughter he erupted into.  “Hahaha, you should have seen your face!  You were so scared.”  Kalco put a hand over his mouth to try to hide how hard he was laughing with the result far beyond his expectations of how much he scared her.  “But don’t worry, I’m the hero that saves everyone,” he threw a hand through his short, spiky hair, “naturally.”
“I…wasn’t scared!”  Ryla was one of the younger women on the military base.  She did not stand out much, and was actually personally surprised Kalco even bothered talking to her.  Other than perhaps Zaier, Kalco was the most known out of the eighty people that inhabited the tenth base on the planet Reiko.  “Normally I am pretty good about feeling that kind of stuff before it happens.”
“Guess when a hot guy is teasing you, your mind goes blank.”
Ryla turned her face to hide a blush over being so jumpy.  Kalco was a soldier of some renown and she hated inevitably looking weak in his eyes.  She was barely out of academies and he was a fighter of some repute; even their stature reaffirmed her inferiority since she barely came up to his muscular chest.  She turned to look at him, seeing him still grinning.  She caught the edge of a scar on his face and looked away quickly again.  Even his scars were so cool.  He claimed it was from fighting a Daijin Star and that their injuries interfere with nanite healing, thus the scar.  Ryla didn’t know if that was true, but it just added to the countenance of him being a confident, experienced mature guy and she was the dumb embarrassed little girl sent here as redemption for her crime she suspected someone somewhere actually knew about.
Even if she was trying to play it off by looking back out the window, it made her cute he had to admit.  She tried so hard.  He was currently in a relationship with a combat medic named Laina – whom he’d known since both their rotational assignments to Reiko-10 – but thought the younger Ryla was cute in a bashful sort of way.  Her medium length hair and her ribbon were so childlike.  It gave him the impression of a girl not really experienced in the world yet before she’d realize that wearing ribbons seemed like too idealistic of a façade to maintain.  Kalco was older than the young Ryla, but the age gap didn’t bother him.  He did wonder, though, if Laina was not in the picture, would something like that be an obstacle to Ryla?  Well, there was no harm in diversifying his portfolio…
“What are you looking at out there?”  Kalco stepped up to her side to take a look.  In the corner of his eyes he noted her taking a small step away from him; her timid nature was cute.
Ryla was nervous talking to Kalco.  It was like a popular, hot-shot athlete back at Primary talking to the book worm, only that never happened in real life, so this was unprecedented.  He had said ‘hi’ to her before, but she was low on the chain around here, as far as popularity went.  Technically she was actually one of the higher ranking members on this base because she was in the comm. section – only a few positions behind Zaier the Commander - but the technicality was superseded by the reality that on frontier outposts like this, rank did not mean much.  
Well, that’s what she felt anyway.  Zaier was the type that was going to make sure everyone knew he was in control, and had enough confidence to make up for any doubt anyone else had.  In contrast her friend Solide was literally on the bottom of the org chart, and likewise he had his own confidence of not giving any thought what anyone else believed.  Well, she hoped her and Solide were friends anyway, he was pretty gruff to nearly everyone, but at least would say hello to her.  She knew more people looked up to him than her simply because of how tough and strong he was.  He had a deep scar across his eye, she found intriguing for their rarity with modern technology, but he never mentioned if it was from Daijins like Kalco claimed.  Unlike Kalco, Solide never talked about his past, ever.
She smiled to herself a bit, enjoying her good luck with these older guys around her showing some interest, even if she was a little scared talking to them.  She was absent-mindedly twirling a bit of her hair and the ribbon she wore while answering Kalco, “I really like the mornings,” she paused for a moment before continuing, “they give me a hope.”
Kalco was surprised at the serious answer.  “A hope?”


“Yeah, an everlasting hope…”
He laughed once.  “Wow, you are kind of serious.  You remind me of a Star Priestess I knew.”  He put a hand on her shoulder.  “But…uh, don’t you think that seriousness takes away from ‘hope’?”  Was he flirting with her?  She was really bad at this kind of stuff.
She turned and looked at him with a gentle smile.  “Not at all!”  Her eyes caught a large black object hanging from his waist, realizing it was a highly customized battle pistol he kept with him.  Seeing the object of violence made Ryla sad in reminiscence.  She looked away, trying to keep her thoughts happy.  No, she wasn’t going there.  The decision was made, and the payment in progress.
“Feyria told me you’ve been picking up the copter pretty fast,” Kalco said to her.
Ryla almost blushed again.  Having attractive Kalco talk to her was novel, and being complimented by the beautiful Feyria made her feel doubly undeserving of this attention and praise.  “Well…it’s a lot different than the V-plane but…Feyria is a really good teacher.  She said I had a good knack for it.”
It was silent for a while.  Was Ryla supposed to say something?  Was Kalco actually flirting with her or was she imagining it?  She eventually muttered out, “Uh…so what are you doing today?”  She cringed a bit at how bad it was; that was just the thing that someone like Kalco would respond with a ‘Well been nice knowing you, have a good life’ type of response.
A new male voice called to them in the room, “Perfect, my best soldier and my best assistant.”  They turned to face Zaier as he took a few steps – more like strides with a focus to them – into the room.  He had long dark hair that came to his shoulders in the back, and was shorter in the front.  His hair hid his face slightly, which added to the cold and calculating personality he had.  “You picked a bad time to take a break,” he said to Ryla.  Zaier had a stern feel to him, but from what she saw on how he interacted with others, he was far nicer to her; she considered him a friend, maybe he did to her as well. She considered everyone her friend, as most people were nice to her, even if she was shy at times.
“Why?” she asked, puzzled.  
Kalco was still thinking, ‘Damn right’ to the best soldier comment when he caught the end of what Zaier had said, and the beginning of a very bad portend it represented.
“…lost contact with Reiko-7.”
Kalco snapped to attention.  “What did you say?”
“Reiko-7 went completely silent right before I came here.  The feed we were getting went from normal, to bad, to silent in a very short period of time.  Ryla knows a little of the blips we were getting last night and the last couple days, but whatever happened came to a rapid head.  The sensors sent across multiple fires, and then it went dead.”  It was a testament to Zaier’s personality where something like this wholly unfazed him.
“Blips?”  Kalco turned to Ryla.
She answered easily.  When it came to her job she was good with speaking; it was things like flirting she was bad with.  “Indeed, I had first noted some strange entries during the last couple cycles.  Things about tools missing, fuel shortages, nothing completely abnormal except there was far more than expected for a short time frame.  I told Zaier, and he gave me the go-ahead to do some advanced tapping into their computers, and there were a lot personal data entries that were odd.”
Kalco knew what they had done needed Commander approval since this was essentially hacking another base.  Given that the bases were purposely autonomous from each other, hacking one wouldn’t go over very well normally. “ ‘Odd’?”  Kalco repeated.
“Stupid things,” Zaier answered for her, looking at Kalco through his slightly longer hair.  The look was cold, which reminded Kalco of Zaier’s attitude towards those he was not friends with.  His eyes were thinner and his more aggressively sloped eyebrows gave a ‘permanently angry at the injustice of being surrounded by idiots’ type of look to him.  “Things when people get stir crazy, paranoid, in need of a rotation off outpost duties.  Basically the type of person that their careers will be short tracked.  They were demonstrating their inferior mental processes.”
“Well, so you thought,” said Ryla.  Kalco braced for a small storm; Zaier was not really the type to be talked back to.  “Alone they might have been easy to just write off, but there were a lot.”
“Indeed.  Perhaps it is part of a clue.”  Kalco found it interesting that Zaier did not discipline Ryla for talking back; he supposed it supported Kalco’s personal observation of Zaier’s warmness towards those he trusted, and a professionalism towards others best described as ‘icy’.  “I am not going into details, but even on the tap it appeared there was a lot of…modification…of data being recorded.  Someone high up was editing the data to make it appear less bad than it was.”
“A lot of people were going crazy, talking about figures in the dark, about not trusting others, people going missing, dying—”
Zaier’s voice turned hard, “That’s enough.”
Ryla shut up quick.
Kalco smiled in his own mind.  Interesting.  Withholding information from him.  That’s fine.  Sounds like they were not sure themselves.  What was inevitable though was him recalling his past and the team loss that got him here.  It was not because they all died, but why they died, or maybe how.  Kalco wasn’t a language teacher, so it didn’t really matter what the right word was, only that the force they got wiped out by had to exist elsewhere in the universe – it just had to.  Thus on some remote level, Kalco knew why he might have been on this dump.  He was way too good of a soldier to be on a random tour like this.  It was quite a leap of logic, but that was the sort of intuition, he told himself, of why he was the sole survivor the first time.  
“So what’s your plan?” Kalco asked in a dismissive tone that belied an animalistic intelligence no one knew he actually possessed.  He pulled out his pistol and started spinning it around the trigger guard with his dominate left hand.  It added to his appearance of thoughtlessness but it actually helped his internal state focus better.  His body and part of his mind were distracted with a simple task so that he could truly think about matters.
Zaier answered him simply, “We are going to investigate.  We are going to take a small crew over there and see what happened.  The weather should hold for the day with it getting worse at dusk, and little is happening here.  I want to personally see this, and Ryla you are coming to lead.”
“What, me?”  She wanted to protest; what was she good at?  What could she do?  She was a young woman who lacked the skills and confidence of Zaier, lacked the combat prowess of Kalco and his popularity.  She was good at logistics she could admit, but there was a difference between organizing flights or people’s activities compared to being in the field trying to ‘lead’ people smarter and more experienced than her.  “A blizzard is coming in tonight and will hold for at least a few cycles,” she stated a fact, hoping somehow it was a protest against going and would get her out of it.
“You are fourth in command here, and I see deep potential in you.  A good leader’s job is being able to bring out the abilities in those under him, I want you to get experience in the field through my guidance.”  What was interesting about Zaier was he was not the toughest, the strongest, the fastest, the smartest, but he was above average in perhaps all of them and his collected, calm demeanor gave him an edge in combat his stats otherwise might have suggested.
Ryla partly wanted to protest further, but was excited in a way hearing his glowing praise; her fortune had really taken a good turn.  To have unflappable Zaier want to train her, and the gorgeous Feyria teach her to fly, she realized she could really make something of herself and redeem the reason she got assigned here.  Feyria was someone she looked up to so much, so graceful and skilled.  One thing Ryla really liked about her was that she had such soft skin. Maybe she should ask her about her regiment, if she wasn’t too embarrassed by bringing up the subject.  
“I assume I’m going?” asked Kalco.
Zaier smirked at him with a slow answer, “Of course, who else is going to protect us in case there are some big scary monsters there?”
“Naturally,” Kalco said reflexively, and really hoped Zaier’s sarcasm was wrong, but on that animal instinct level, Kalco knew he wasn’t.  Further, why would Zaier even have known to mention something like that, as backhanded as it was?  He spun his pistol a few more times.  This just got interesting.  No way Zaier didn’t know better, but that left a lot of questions too.  Zaier definitely had that feel of some ex-intel officer type.  Maybe there were more people on this base that had some deep, past connections than he gave anyone credit for.  Heh, this might be fun.  There might be way more going on here than he initially thought.  He would have to look everyone over now and decide if any of them might actually be more legit than his first glance discounted them for.  There might be an entire party here of people from various groups.
He looked at Ryla, feeling bad for the young girl.  If Kalco was right, she was nowhere ready for what was about to come; just another body sprayed across the ground.  Kalco lifted his face to Zaier, both men looking with expressionless faces at the other.  Kalco had to admit, Zaier looked harder here than he normally gave the smaller-framed man credit for.  
How many people here are just hapless victims, and how many had the Fate Lines chosen as potential champions brought to this destination for this macabre showdown?  Kalco laughed, closing his eyes, only the rhythmic spin calming his mind.  Hard to believe he became so esoteric, but it was impossible not to be after what had happened.
“Why are you laughing?” Ryla was asking.  “Zaier’s ‘joke’?”
“No.”  He paused a moment before he continued.  “Would you believe me if I told you I was actually scared of monsters?”

Reiko-10 was shaped like a large X, with each part of the ‘X’ being a large collection of hallways/rooms called a ‘Wing’.  They were constructed with generally open hallways and the rooms were on each side, thus one could run straight from Alpha wing to the opposite door at Gamma wing, or as the quiet woman Aria noted to herself, easily head-shot somebody from one extreme end of the wing to the opposing wing in a few sight lines.  Aria stood in the corner of the group, silent like she always was, and no one paying attention to her as was typical.  
There were nine others around her that Zaier had chosen for this expedition, and although Aria rarely talked she more than made up for it in observation and knew a lot about most of those she was near.  She knew so much about the others that many of them might find her creepy.  Yes…she’d keep those observations to herself.  Things like that little comm. girl Ryla had split ends in her hair from being too harsh in her cleaning in an over-compensation for her bad self-image, and that some of the males lusted after her more than an actual interest in her; or that the animal officer Rox literally used her hand to comb her hair because she didn’t especially care how she looked.
Yes, she’d keep it to herself that flirty pilot Feyria was likely engaged in intercourse with at least two of the guys present currently and at least three others she knew of on this base.  She wouldn’t say anything to anyone about how suavely Feyria just gave the littlest of butt grabs to that arrogant soldier Kalco with his knowing smile, and while within the scope of Zaier’s mission brief he had brushed her hand innocently along his with the subtlest of grasps from both of them.
Aria brushed part of her hair out of her right eye for a moment before it slowly fell back into place.  She wouldn’t tell Kalco how insecure medical-extraordinaire Laina actually was; that she was super worried Kalco was too good for her and would leave her.  All indicted by the slightest rise of Laina’s lip every time Kalco got within arm distance of another woman – which was often.
‘People really are extremely bad on details,’ Aria thought to herself, amusing her mind as she subtly walked right past Madigan without the slightest awareness from him.  Well, she would have kept mechanic Madigan’s secret of generally being scared of woman, but that was not really a secret, as it became a perverse joke seeing Feyria endlessly make Madigan uncomfortable with her aggressive dominatrix pursuit of anything of opposite sex.  She understood there was a rivalry between the two of them as both were good pilots, but Madigan was more often tasked with fixing the vehicles than flying them.  Aria stepped away from him lest she give him a heart attack from shock and everyone would have to watch Laina work her magic.
Aria only ‘knew’ a few of these people at all beyond perhaps some hygiene foibles or interpersonal associations she could witness; though she could probably tell plenty of disturbing facts the others would find scary she knew about them.
The rotation of crew through here was fairly new, and based on people’s past some were here as retribution or natural progressions.  The former was exemplified by someone like Solide.  He made her uneasy, standing there with his arms crossed, his muscles obvious even with the advanced winter bodysuits they all had on.  His short, flared-back hair added to his general angry demeanor he had on, and a lot about him didn’t add up.  He was not friendly to nearly anyone, yet talked to young Ryla who was about his only friend.  She was slightly timid like Aria, but not to Aria’s paralyzing extent.  But the biggest was the lie they were supposed to be fed that he was just a lowly guard.  Aria wished she could get closer to his shotgun he always kept with him to actually inspect it, as it wasn’t the standard Terra pump action.  Further, something about his face and eyes did not feel good to her.  He had the eyes of a hardened killer.  That of course led to two wildly different reasons why he might be here, and neither sat well with Aria.
Aria walked slowly over to a break in the circle so she could ‘fit in’; sometimes the best cover was in the open, and she was less conspicuous this way.  It happened to be near her friend Railine, and the animal control girl named Rox.  Aria hardly knew Rox as they were in completely different roles, but Rox was friendly to everyone.  She whispered ‘hi’ to Aria and she nodded silent back.
Railine nodded to Aria in his distant stoic way and Aria reciprocated.  She liked Railine.  He was a ‘Birther’ – as nearly everyone except her called them – one of the few on this base, and had undergone gene therapy later.  What was odd, was that he had a Strive on the cheek of his deeply burned face, perhaps some fringe colony that still allowed births, but was also Affiliated with the larger Solarian/Aelisha empire.  He had brown hair which was nearly non-existent for AGEs, but very common through physical reproduction.
In a lot of ways they were completely different based on their past, given she was Aelisha Genetically Engineered and a Classed Soldier, Class: Sniper; but they still arrived at a similar end of outlook and personality.  Railine had a deep pain to him, a faraway look in his eyes that matched her own, and she was sure he felt the same towards her in that magnetism of ‘misery loves company’.  The difference was Aria never talked, and Railine was big into stoicism with an esoteric bent and thus always liked to expound his ideas so someone that would listen.  It was actually really relaxing to be able to spend time with someone and have only the littlest of conversational demands; he was more than happy to have someone listen to his exotic theories on spirituality and the mind.
Zaier was continuing to lay out what had happened at Reiko-7, which was essentially unknown other than a host of mysterious recordings, and apparently loss of contact with the entire base.  
Rox stepped forward.  She was a somewhat forceful woman, a light bulldozer of sorts whom Aria imagined would be really good at wrestling animals down to the ground if they needed to be.  Rox was not ‘manly’ but the few times Aria saw her in the gym, she had some musculature to her the other females here did not.  She looked more the type to be at home in mud than a frozen ice world.  “I got two questions,” she began, not waiting to see if the questions would be acknowledged.  “First, why not use a satellite or something to just see what is going on, and two, why are you bringing me?”
Ryla began, “The satellites…”
Zaier lifted a hand to quiet her.  “The weather affects the satellites anomalously.  Ask Madigan if you want the details.”
Rox turned, placing a hand on her waist.  “Madi~!  Tell me what’s wrong with the satellites!”  Rox had a grin on that spoke to her mischievous nature, having seen the fun Feyria got from tormenting poor Madigan; Rox thought it would be fun to get in on it.  Aria really liked the beads Rox wore on the side of her shoulder-length hair.  She liked hair ornaments but was too shy to wear them herself.  For that reason she also enjoyed Ryla’s long ribbon she often wore as well.
“You don’t know me; don’t act like you do, so call me Madigan.”  He had shifted his away from her, taking a step back from her.  “The atmosphere has a very high latent ionic component that not only leads to the extreme and erratic weather here, but it also severely compromises consistent communication.  Mixed with the bad blizzard socking us in soon, it could be really bad.”
Feyria sauntered up to Madigan from his side, her hips kicking out so naturally sexy, it was something Aria had about zero skill in.  She placed a hand on his shoulder.  “Isn’t he so smart~!”
His face became taut in shock as he realized she was touching him and knocked her hand off.  Aria and Madigan were the type that they actually would probably be friends, but were tragically never going to be.  Aria was far too timid and shy and Madigan had a phobia of woman.  It hurt Aria to see the girls pick on him.  To her it was obvious he had a very deep scar over something; his paranoia was far beyond normal.
Feyria laughed.  “But to answer your question, it’s why we have a hard time flying in a lot of this weather.  The snow is one thing, but there are a lot of electrical disturbances.”  Feyria began stretching her arms over her head, sticking his chest out conspicuously.  “You know if you show him some of your assets he might give you some one on one attention…”
“Really?” Rox said, jokingly considering her innuendo.
Madigan bit the bottom of his lip, holding his tongue over whatever was on his mind.  Madigan interested Aria.  It was sad she did not know much about him, along with the fact they would never talk.  
“Enough,” Zaier’s voice cut down the banter.  “To finish your question, you are coming because you are one of the few animal control officers and we do not know what to expect.  If their dogs are loose you are the only one out of us who can keep them under control.  Guess animals recognize one of their own.”  There were a few stifled laughs over what might have been a backhanded insult.  Zaier started walking to the large door that led outside to the hangar.  “Come.”  The nine of them followed.
The door opened with a slow grind.  There was a whirring of the small energy fields used from repulsing the snow as they forced the snow back from coming inside given the pressure and temperature change of the recently opened door.  The ten all pulled their hoods over their heads as they walked the short distance to the large hangar.
Outside, to Aria’s right and far down near the Gamma wing exit there was a red light on one of the snow repulsion units.  She put on a few lens of magnification over her eyes and confirmed that something was not right.  It was obvious with the zoomed-in view that the unit was broken, as a large wind drift of snow made the path nearly impossible to traverse.  Odd, Aria knew those things did not break easily, they were very noisy when they needed maintenance, but to go down?  Someone would fix it while they were gone.
“Did I ever tell you how cute you look rolled up like a little snowman?” Kalco teased as he poked Laina in her side.
“This is the same clothes we always wear only we have our hoods on…” Laina said back.
Aria did not know either of these two personally.  Kalco was a big playboy type but had stayed away from Aria which was fine with her.  Laina was a very skilled medic, the best the base had, which was convenient for Aria because everyone went to Laina instead.  It spared her a lot of contact she would otherwise have to have.  Aria was fairly skilled in medicine.  A lot of it was more practical than theoretical, honed by actual use in battlefields.  Providing medical assistance on the battlefield came to her easier than doing so on base because she didn’t feel as much pressure to talk when bullets were flying; she merely had to do her job.  Laina was the ‘Oh sweetie, don’t worry, I’ll get you patched right up,’ type, complete with head petting.  It worked if you could pull it off, Aria knew she was nowhere close to the right personality.
The large doors of the hangar groaned open from the group’s proximity and the two aerial vehicles stood there in maintained perfection of Madigan and the other mechanics.  The Gryo-Copter was an all-around good vehicle and Aria had taken many trips them into hostile locales across Solarian lines.  She could appreciate the ability to disembark nearly anywhere, but it lacked the capacity and speed the V-Plane had.
Once inside the hangar she threw her hood off as she did not like the claustrophobic feel it gave her.  She felt it reduced her senses somewhat, namely her hearing and peripheral vision.  She pushed her hood to the side of her large rifle that was slung over her back.  ‘Broken Promise’ had served her through so many battles, saved her so many times, she would never let go of the weapon.  Zaier luckily did not push the point of requesting her to not travel around with it.  Seeing Kalco and Solide openly carrying custom weapons with no complaint, it was clear Zaier was being prudent here.
Others around her joked and laughed, talking about what might have happened while she silently got onto the V-Plane.  Sat in the back, placed her rifle across her lap, and looked out the window.  Unfortunately someone might still sit next to her but all the popular people were hanging out near the front which was good.  Railine broke out of the crowd coming towards her.  “Mind if I sit here?”  He lifted a thumb behind him, “It’s too loud up there”  Aria shook her head no, shifting the awkwardly large rifle for the small plane to the side so he could sit down.
Of the nine on here with her she only knew two of them and had an unsubstantiated tolerance of two others.  Railine was her friend and about the only person on this base she could talk to, and the other was Zaier.  That situation was complicated because they had known each other in the past and she didn’t think he remembered her anymore as a lot had happened.  She got a good feeling off both Rox and Madigan, but never talked beyond the vaguest of greeting to the former, and pure utilitarian for the latter of ‘socket’ ‘driver’ and so on when Aria was in the Armory with Madigan fixing something.
Of course she knew ‘of’ Kalco, or Feyria, as they were the big shots in a way on the base.  Kalco for his intolerable arrogance, and Feyria for a flirtatiousness that also was intolerable.  Once, while talking to Railine, he pointed out that it was that maybe it was envy Aria had for her, for the ease she lived her life.  Aria had to reluctantly agree, and had been confused ever since as to whether she actually disliked Feyria or secretly wished so could be even a fifth as bold as she was.
It did not really matter, as her rotation off this planet was nearly upon her.  Why she was sent her after so many hot zones did not make sense.  She liked the break for a bit but grew bored and stressed from the general tight-knit nature the location imposed on them.  The only real question Aria had in her mind was whether she could actually talk to Zaier about their shared past.  Realistically she did not think she could.
“Hahaha!”  Kalco’s laugh reached her all the way in the back as she caught part of his words.  “…don’t crash us just because you want me to have to save you Feyria!”
On the speakers of the vehicle Feyria shot back, “Your muscles are nice to look at, but I am afraid they might use a bit too much food energy if we were to crash in the mountains to keep you around for long.”  There was a sigh as the vehicle started up.  “Eye candy loses its allure after a while, especially when you are hungry…”
“You are telling me girl!”  There were some laughs further up.
She had an unease about them, but that didn’t count for much as she didn’t like people in general.  Kalco was another one that Aria contemplated upon after her talk with Railine regarding her ‘envy’ of Feyria.  Did she dislike Kalco because he never shut up and was always on one girl or another, and because he was always bragging how strong he was or how good he was at fighting?  Or did she dislike him because it was a reflection of her own broken-ness, a sort of distorted mirror reflection of how boisterous he was, and her on the opposite end of barely able to even talk when approached?
“Are you doing okay?” Railine asked her in his soft voice from a rather hard body.  She looked at him briefly, then down, nodded and looked back out the window.  
“How many of these guys do you know?” Railine questioned and pointed forward through the seat.  It was a question she would actually have to answer unfortunately.  
She turned to face him.  He was resting his chin on his hand with his jaw slowly chewing some gum and one finger supporting the side of his face.
“Only a few.”
The fact that they were friends should not have come as a surprise given their reticence out of both of them.  Railine was a normal introvert, but he could still talk to people and opened up when he was friends with someone.
“I look at those gathered here and it’s strange to me,” Railine replied, looking forward over the rows of seats.  The anti-grav plates had engaged as the V-Plane hung silently off the ground, sliding forward out of the hangar to the longer runway.  The ‘runway’ was much shorter than the long stretches they used to be before grav tech became ubiquitous in vehicles.  All that was needed was simply a clean and flat spot to actually set the vehicle down, and a short area to accelerate forward; overall it made takeoffs much faster.  There was only a subtle vibration as the base started rushing passed and they were airborne.
Railine continued, “There is a perfect mix of all the groups here.  Medical, techs, fighters, leaders…why?”  The question seemed more to himself than her so she stayed silent.  “It makes no sense.  We lost contact with Seven, and we bring…soldiers?  Why, Aria?”
Broken Promise was wedged in the corner of the wall of the plane and the seat in front of her, but she still kept one hand on it at all times.  “I was not told anything.”
“Someone like you makes sense for a war zone since you can fight and heal.  And—oh, by the way,” he began as he rolled his right shoulder a bit, pulling the flexible winter jacket they all had on down past his toned neck and trapezius to show a large shoulder with a pink line on it.  “Can hardly even tell where I got cut, thanks.”  He smiled at her; she blushed and looked down for a moment.  “Kept me from having to see Laina.”
“Do you not like her?”  Aria was skilled at trauma medicine, no need to deny that reality, but Laina was the best on the base, and amazing with how good and fast she was.
He shrugged.  “It’s not in my nature to judge those I hardly know, but we are different, that’s all.  You are more my affinity.”  They got back to the point he started before the side conversation.  “Anyway, you have a weird group here.  Send me, Madigan, Rox and it makes sense: trying to fix some comms or something.  Send you, Kalco, and whatever his name is, Dolde,” Railine pointed to the angry, spiked-back-hair man who was ahead of them staring out the window silently with his shotgun leaning the same way Aria’s weapon was, “and it speaks of someone needing to be taken down.”
“Solide,” she corrected him.  “Sol, like our home star.  Feyria screws up his name, but I think it is on purpose because he turned her down once.”  
  He shrugged.  “I don’t like him.  He has a really bad aura to him.  If the two of us were ever on a team, it wouldn’t be good.  It’d take a hundred missions before I trusted that guy.”
“A thousand at least,” Aria said.
“Ten thousand,” Railine responded.  
“A lifetime of missions,” she one-upped him.  They both laughed with their humor they had with each other.
“He’s really strong, insanely so.  Him and Kalco both.”
One thing Aria liked about Railine was he had a degree of humbleness to him.  He was considerate and kind, but he had a deep well of intellect and while tall and toned was way stronger than he looked; he looked capable.  It was statements like that though, compared to a typical male of either evading or ‘well, I can beat him at this instead!’ that Aria appreciated and liked.
“Well he does look strong.”
Railine was still talking about him.  “In the gym he is always alone, but the weight he throws around is impressive.  Depending on what we’re talking, I’m probably about 3rd strongest on the base, but Kalco and especially Solide have me beat.  He reps my max weights easily.”
“They are AGEd, and they feel like ex-special ops guys to me, maybe even Classed.”  Aria would know more than most.  If they actually were ex-Classed Soldiers then they were among the best the Solarian race had to offer in terms of technology of creation, training, and raw mentality.  The fact that a non-genetically engineered Solarian could even come close was perhaps more of a testament to Railine.  The gene therapy Railine would have gotten at some point would bring out the best his innate genetics were capable of – quite a rise no doubt – but were simply not as potent as purely engineered.
In general you were not supposed to go around saying if you were a Classed, namely because you might be targeted or compromise a mission.  Typically you were probably tough enough it wouldn’t matter, regardless she had shared some of her past with Railine.  Part of it, was given what had happened, it was unclear if she was still even active Classed anymore.  It was a fitting irony for their friendship that small-framed Aria was an elite military sniper, and large, strong Railine was as civilian as they come.
“Regardless, why have his type on this outing among others?”  Railine looked down, rubbing his chin.  Aria felt bad for him with his deeply burned face mixed with his good natured personality.
She did not know the story regarding his burns, mainly due to her never asking, but it certainly did not help his introverted nature being so disfigured in the face.  It was on some degree sad, as anyone not bothering to get to know him because of that fact would miss out on a really thoughtful person.
Unless an injury was extremely severe, any AGEd injury would likely heal enough to not leave the significant damage he had.  Though it was not completely perfect, as both Solide and Kalco had scars, but given their nature as some sort of combat role it was not hard to imagine an alien slash or bullet graze across their face that left the scar.  Faces tended to not heal nearly as well as other parts of the body with nanites; Aria did not know why, but that was just what she observed.
So, in a roundabout way, the severity of his facial scarring ‘hid’ his origin as someone could simply attribute it to being one of the ‘severe’ type injuries that nanites were unable to heal.  Not like he kept it secret, he had openly told Aria various stories of his family that generally were happy.  
Aria was likely the only person that knew that about Railine.  It was not a huge secret but some people really looked down on it.  Perhaps the fact that it didn’t bother her – and he knew that – was part of the reason they were close to each other.  He was probably Aria’s only friend here actually.
Aria hated the term ‘Birther’ and would never use it.  She had someone she cared about very deeply in her past that was also born by a woman and thus did not have the disdain many did.  On fringe assignments like this, there tended to be far more people who were born, thus the dislike for them never reached high levels as it might deep in core sectors anyway.
It had been silent for a while before he spoke, “Jeez, I sure am talking a lot…”  Railine had a sheepish look on his face.
“Yeah…”
They both laughed at the joke nearly no one else on this plane or even the base would understand.
Outside the large window – it really might as well be called the whole wall since it took up the entire side of the plane – the white landscape sped by under them.  It was tough to tell speed or distance beyond watching some mountains far away that slowly passed by.  Someone could probably make it walking from one base to another, but it would likely be a whole day endeavor at a full march, fighting the snow, and that’s assuming not dying to the elements which was very real.  The distance was not insurmountable, especially if it was nice with no hostile weather, but without vehicles it would take heroic effort to get between them.
Aria offered her opinion to the silence, “Zaier is being prepared for all contingencies.  He wanted a well-rounded team for the apparent unknown we are going into.”
Railine moved his head back with the subtlest of expressions – surprise – not because she was talking, but talking about Zaier.  Aria was good with subtle body motions; it was her sniper nature to notice small things, but it wasn’t to say she was good at interpreting what they always meant.
“You know that?  You actually know anything about him?”  The question of course pre-supposed everyone ‘knew’ Zaier as he was the Base Commander, but he did not interact with the underlings much, of which both Aria and Railine were in that category.
“A bit.”
Railine left her comment at that, like Aria knew he would.  That is why she liked him, after all.  Aria did know Zaier, in a way.
‘In a way…’
Aria was glad she didn’t have many emotions left, because the few ones she had left hurt and confused her.
Solide sat there with his head resting on two fingers of his left hand, a bemused pissed-off-ness settled on his mind.  He didn’t give a shit about these people he was with.  He didn’t trust any of them, and couldn’t give a fuck about them trusting him back.  He knew it was only a matter of time before it happened again.  That’s why he was probably here.
That’s why all these fucking freaks were on this base, some backwards ice planet bullshit loaded with tons of Classed Soldiers with Face ReCons, highly AGEd civs, criminals with too good of skills to just plug… heh, he doubted there was a single ‘normal’ person on the entire planet of Reiko, or certainly not at least at Reiko-10.  He wondered if the other bases had such esteemed company as this one did.  He didn’t doubt for a moment there might have been some Aelisha in disguise or some other alien here with its dirty hands all over this.
Reiko-7 was likely down.  ‘Down’ like dead, like ran the fuck over like his previous unit.  
‘Braidddd!’  Solide gritted his teeth, turning his face into his chest slightly.  Fuck man, he really wanted to take some of those memory wipe pills but didn’t trust them to not wipe out things he actually wanted to remember.
“Hey,” a young girl’s caring voice called him while there was a soft tug on his jacket.  He turned to see Ryla, the only person he trusted in this shithole beyond Mr. ‘Kalco’.  He mainly trusted her because she was too fucking young and naïve to be a Classed, and wasn’t a specialized civ planted here like some of those techs.  She was probably a girl that got caught up in some crime that she didn’t know any better and this was her redemption.  Poor girl.  He felt bad for her as an old reminder of an innocence annihilated out of his heart a million shotgun shells ago.  “Are you okay?”
If it was anyone else his first option would have been ‘Fuck off’, or a lie of ‘headache’, but he told her a modified version of the truth, “Bad thoughts is all.”
One thing Ryla did that won a small slice of Solide’s heart was show him kindness despite the difference in their rank.  ‘Officially’ Solide was literally on the fucking bottom of the organizational ranking chart in this bitch.  He was a no name ‘guard’, guarding who the fuck knew what, and was extremely powerless compared to the esteemed Zaier – Classed: Piece of Shit – leader of this base.  Solide doubted any idiot at this base even considered Zaier was an ex or active Classed Solider, but Solide had suspicions, it took one to know one, and he had a bad feeling about him.  Probably an Intel or Leader type, there was always a tension between those and Assaults.
“I am a bit scared honestly.  To think their comms went out…”
Ryla was cute in that her words implied she still thought anyone at Reiko-7 was alive.
“Don’t be.”  Solide grabbed her wrist.  “I’ll protect you, but if the shit starts getting crazy you have to…”
“Have to what?” she asked puzzled.
“Come with me if you want to live.”
Her face frowned at the perhaps exaggerated outburst out of Solide.  “Okay…”
Ryla had pretty nice sized tits for her small frame, maybe that’s another thing that warmed his heart about her.  She was really young too so he knew he’d have a great time pillaging her tightness.  Man, he really liked smaller girls like that, throwing them around was such a pleasure, most of the time they were crazy and liked every moment of it.  He smiled at the train of thought for a moment, but he viewed her more like a sister – if he had any idea what having one might be like – and never bothered to really pursue it beyond the thought of chalking up just another tally in a column named ‘Slays’; only those ‘Slays’ were sexual in nature instead of the ‘Slays’ column of blown away bodies he had going.
The ribbon she wore was a bit childish, but really damn cute.  He tried to not let too many fantasies of what he could do with it make it far in his mind.  In a lot of ways, she reminded him of Star Priestesses; they almost always had bows and ribbons on.  Such sweet gals, until they mind raped you, or tackled and neural erased you.  Maybe in retrospect he hated them as much as he wanted to fuck them.
On this plane alone there were at least four he thought had face ReCons, including him.  He rubbed the scar on his cheek; that bitch really hurt, why couldn’t they get rid of that thing?  Some bullshit about ‘nanite steady state’.  Solide was pretty sure he hit the guy who told him he couldn’t erase that scar because it wasn’t his damn steady state.
Solide had quite a few tricks, and one of them came through right now when he picked up a covert ICS communication.  The receiver of the message was secured, and given the general nature of ICS, Solide really should not have been able to detect the sender either, but well…he had friends in low places and that’s why he was on this shithole…one way or another.
Feyria had started speaking; that girl got around pretty damn good, but never approached Solide with implications of sex other than a few times she bothered him at the gym with her haughty little flirts.  Trite bitch.  It was fine with him, beyond some coy little sentences she told him once before he told her to fuck off.  Not that he wouldn’t hit it, but there was a satisfaction in his isolation; plus she seemed like someone that wouldn’t keep her mouth closed.  Fine for certain moments, but the last thing he needed was drama from the bitches of who was sleeping with whom.
Oh wow…well that explains why you could not contact Seven. – Feyria said over the intercepted message he had.
Despite talking shit about her, Feyria would make a good soldier in a way, he thought.  She had that ‘oh wow our team just got blown away’ nonchalant attitude that was critical for surviving fucked up situations.  It likely spoke to her being mentally damaged somehow, but hell, combat did that to a lot of people.
Solide closed his eyes so he could better ‘see’ the tap he was getting from her hacked Internal Communication System she was talking to someone on here.  A holograph appeared in the air in front of him: Reiko-7 was charred ruins with a few pillars of smoke, the only black thing amidst the white background.
Unconsciously until now, he realized he was holding his shotgun with one hand at this point.  Some people called him delusional or paranoid but fuck those faggots, he was still alive, that’s what mattered.  Let them go through what he had and see if they were still alive.
He grabbed the young girl’s wrist again.  For a moment he whimsically thought that he really should have fucked Ryla at some point, and that slut Feyria.  This was the beginning of the end.  He only saw more shotgun shells in his future…many, many more.  “Listen to me, things are happening that you are not going to understand at first, and if you want to live you need to stay very close to me and listen to anything I say, got it?”
Ryla’s eyebrows slopped down in worry, but she nodded solemnly.  Solide had thrown her wrist away harder than he meant to as he retreated into his mind, both hands crossed in front of his nose, the barrel of the shotgun brushing against his spiky hair.
So that stupid little slut was in on the inside track of some intel around here.  The likely target for her message was Zaier, or Kalco, he doubted anyone else.  No one else here had that edge to them the Solide recognized from deep in the shadow world.  He was not too bothered by the fact they were keeping it secret from everyone right now; he’d keep it secret from these fuckers also.  What bothered him was that there was some government force operating here that he was not aware of.  That was one thing that pissed him off, in the upper levels of secrecy everyone was trying to get everyone else, and it was impossible to know what team was where and who was on it.
Zaier knew…that little bitch.  He had to be Classed for sure.  This confirmed what he already believed.  He just stank of Leader class, and would have the clearance to know what the fuck was likely to occur here.  Of course he’d pick a mixed group like this; Leader’s were always about trying to recover resources – in other words people, guns, vehicles – to use to their cause, and if Reiko-7 could be kept alive at least for a while then it bought them time.  Zaier knew this, or at least did on some level, but did not expect the full overrun so fast.  Solide really wished he was further up in the plane to see his face, but Zaier had good control so his face might not betray much.
Shit, the significance of the R-7 wipeout now hit him.  In the circles he still ran with, but deeply wanted out of, was suggesting this alien force was getting stronger.  It was strong enough it obliterated four elite Classed teams, but that they were still growing in strength.
Skipping ahead with potentially questionable logic, it seemed clear that all the bases on Reiko were put here entirely to be slaughtered as a test of the new power of this force.  Each base may have been composed of people not unlike Solide, Kalco and Zaier.  Even if Leaders weren’t worth shit, there had to have been at least one Assault at Reiko-7, not that it would have mattered given what happened with the Elyria Modality.
He didn’t know about the combat ability of R-7 but it should have at least put up a fight with some of its guys.  But it was gone within a cycle…destroyed.  None of these fuckers here had a clue…or maybe some of them do.  Goddamn it, no wonder he couldn’t trust anyone.
‘Call me crazy, but look at the facts.  How could you not come to this conclusions?’
Yeah, no one who called him crazy was still breathing, that was for sure.
He turned around, seeing the burnt guy and the sniper girl.  He wouldn’t have given her much thought other than once when he heard her talking about that she was Classed herself.  Pretty obvious she was Sniper, but it made Solide wonder if the burnt guy was one himself.  He didn’t have quite that edge to him, but he was still physically impressive so Solide attributed him to some sort of Solarian special ops team.  Fire boy and sniper girl, two more soldiers sent into the slaughter this was looking like it was about to become.  He started laughing…holy shit was every single person here some sort of government lackey?
If what he thought had happened to Reiko-7 was true, there would be no one alive.  If there was anyone left at Reiko-7 ‘alive’ Solide was going to pump them full of shells and dump a fucking grenade on their ass – it didn’t matter if it was a young boy or some hot slutty bitch – before they even opened their mouth.  Maybe it might make a difference…might.
Prior to this morning’s events, the time had passed so painfully slow here.  He didn’t know what the fuck he was on this planet for, but now it was clicking into place quickly.
’17, 18, 19,20…That makes 40…’  Forty extra shells hidden on him…that would not be enough for even one of those fuckers.  And if one of them here at Reiko-10 was already infected…holy shit…!
Solide was standing up, looking totally frantic at the others in the plane, most still looking out the window at the landscape passing by.
“Solide?  You look very scary right now… Are you okay?” Ryla asked him.
To some extent he had become disjointed from reality.  The conclusions he was reaching were based on a very thin trail of evidence, but that did not stop his paranoia.  It was not entirely blame-able because what he had went through would likely have shattered most people, so some damage was not unexpected.
‘Holy shit…fuck, one of these fuckers could be one already!’  His eyes shot back and forth to everyone in the cabin with him, his mind coming up with reasons and explanations for why one of them was ‘it’, already.  
This was partly why no one liked him and distrusted him, but he could not give a shit.  He knew he was right, he just had to get out alive.
He wasn’t crazy.
‘No, I’m not fucking crazy.’
No not at all.  He closed his eyes and imagined mountains all around him constructed of spent shotgun shells, fired by him one at a time.  One at a time.
An eternity of firing – maybe it was enough.
Maybe.
He reached for his shotgun, but realized it was already in his hand.
Perfect.
One at a time. 

Feyria really hated deception and intrigue; she generally liked to play it straight.  Feyria was really tempted to start performing tricks with the V-Plane just to get her mind off of things.  Give it a little extra thrust, push down here, pull up there and away we go!  Just like males~
If she did, Zaier would be ‘forced’ to yell at her about it not being appropriate but…they had an understanding.  He’d yell at her in front of everyone but it would all be made up later in his room.  She really liked his room.  Best in the base!  She liked being there beyond just the room, honest~  He had that slightly longer hair that framed his angry face so well.  He just looked so intense normally and when he was punishing bad girls she thought it really brought out his sadistic side…joking!…kind of~
It was more fun to play with others than worry about who knew what, and who to keep secrets from.  “Hey Kalco, I have to know, are you doing some reverse compensating with your little pop gun?” she asked, the amplifier picking up her voice and broadcasting it to the whole plane; she didn’t really care the party poopers in the back were all down and quiet.  The fun people were up front.
She liked a lot of the people on this picnic.  Zaier had this pained passion when they were making love; his distraction was a temptation to her to try to find out the real reason his heart was so guarded.  But beyond that, Kalco was a lot like her; they both enjoyed life and knew it was short so you might as well enjoy the ride.  She didn’t really care that Laina was his main lay, but Laina might care if she knew Feyria was in his rotation…hehe.
‘Enjoy the ride!’ She smiled, gripping the control and really wanting to start going faster.
“You know,” Kalco began, clearly going to say some planned comeback, “I could say something about finesse being more important than size…but no need to sell myself short.”
Laina laughed from next to him, rubbing his arm and causing Feyria to roll her eyes.  Feyria really should have been with Kalco…not her.  Feyria was better in every way, she felt.  It didn’t really matter though.  She wasn’t the type for monogamy.  It slowed her down way too much, and for all involved it was fine.
“I don’t know, in my experience the only thing that really turns me on is guys that can keep up,” Rox said characteristically boldly.  “You don’t seem so…frustrated…so your taste must be different, but the amount of guys that can pin me down is pitiful.”
Feyria laughed to herself.  She liked Rox.  They were different in a lot of ways but they both knew what they wanted with males and went for it, so she had to respect that.  She really liked Rox’s arms too.  They were just a touch too muscular but she really liked how toned they were.  Rox had helped her with some tricep exercises a while back.
A powerful gust of wind hit the V-Plane, strong enough it made the compensators turn on momentarily as they bounced from the turbulence.  
“Whoa!”  Rox laughed.  “That a girl Feyria, I knew you liked it the same way!”
“If you think she felt that small jerk, you better re-evaluate your read on her,” Zaier said in a distant tone.  In a reflection, Feyria caught him giving Rox a cold smirk.
Feyria smiled.  That bastard…  She jammed the throttle to max, diving the plane then immediately pulling up.  It sent a quick shockwave through the plane and everyone gasped.  “Shit!” was a general cry from a few.
“Whoa, some crazy wind here, better buckle up!” she yelled.  Zaier looked forward at her, giving a hard gaze.  He’d be punishing her later…she couldn’t wait.
“What the hell…!?” Kalco yelled  “The weather is clear, how is it this turbulent?  Flying can’t be that hard!”
“Well shooting isn’t that hard, but that’s your only job.”  Feyria smiled at her own joke that got a few up front to giggle.  She turned around, noting there was a pretty strong delineation between the extroverts and the…not so fun people.  Near the front was Kalco and his main girlfriend Laina, whom Feyria hardly interacted with at all.  She seemed nice enough, but she wondered what he saw in her.  Sure her boobs were bigger but…she sure seemed like a fish in bed, just had that feeling to her.  Both Laina and Rox were the oldest women here, about mid to late 20s on the old Terra revised scale.  God, her hair was atrocious too, it had this little upswept thing in the front she never combed away, so unkempt.  Unkempt looked good on guys like Kalco, but a woman who didn’t maintain her appearance really called in a lot of questions about everything, not including other aspects of her hygiene.
Anyway, Zaier and Rox were next down the line.  Feyria and Zaier had a special relationship that it was best if kept secret.  He let her get away with a lot in exchange for some slightly depraved alone time.  Though she had to admit, she was probably the depraved one and he just accommodated her!
Rox was a wild girl.  Feyria liked her because she was the ‘strong woman’ type who would beat up guys for saying the wrong thing, and strong enough to do it.  She was a major tomboy, always wrestling with the dogs…and apparently the guys too.  Hehe that was fun, but not Feyria’s style.  They had never really sat down and talked, but a few times at meals they were at the same table and were always quick to hop in with each other’s jokes so Feyria gave her the stamp of approval.  If Feyria could throw a party here she would definitely invite Rox.  Get that girl drunk and the fun would really start, bet she could outdrink anyone here.
Midway back was her Madi, Ryla, and what the heck was that guy…Sold or Solid or Solday.  Yeah, that last one sounded right.  She only remembered it because it was pronounced different than it looked.
Madigan was attractive for a lot of the wrong reasons.  Like all pilots he had orange hair like her, but it was darker, bordering on brown, and had dark eyes unlike her bright ones.  She was designed to be a small vehicle pilot, and he was likely destined for large vehicles if he made the eventual cut.
A lot of his traits were attractive to her.  He had a distant look to him, was standoffish with girls because he could not stand them, was decent with guns, was really good mechanic and was nearly as good as her at flying.  She’d seen his skill set before.  He was probably a starship captain type.
Out on fringe assignments like this there were two types of people, those who were young and fast-tracked to bigger things, or those who were older and had screwed up and this was a sort of punishment.  He was likely the former.
She didn’t think he was gay, but he had a crippling fear of women.  It was kind of embarrassing, but it was his life not hers; she found it fun to constantly press her body into him from behind and watch his panicked face while he got away from her.  It deeply fascinated her having a guy that was so blatantly not interested in her.  It made her want him more.
Ryla was a nice girl, cute but didn’t know how to leverage her sexuality.  She was kind of the awkward nerd type that would trip over her mid-sized sweater all the time and some hapless loser finds out she is super-hot under her wool exterior.  She’d be the type who wore a one-piece swimsuit and be super bashful about her large bra size.  Some AGEd engineer must really have been putting a bit too much growth hormone in the latest batch Ryla came out from…  Feyria wondered if it was too late for her to get a little of a boost if that’s what men were into more now.  She had been out of the scene a while since getting assigned here.  Tons of fashion to catch up on once she was out of here.
Feyria had thought about teaching her some ways of women.  She was teaching her how to fly, but not sure she wanted to unleash a young harlot on a base she had under control fairly well.  Feyria was smart enough to realize the different types men fall for, and the ‘innocent hottie’ type was effective even if Feyria was a bit too grown up to use it anymore.  She imagined Ryla pulling some guys arm in between the space in her chest, twirling her ribbon while saying, ‘It’s so scary and lonely out on this base~’.
Feyria giggled to herself.  She’d used variations of that one to large effect.  ‘Oh my, you are just so strong~’.  Both parties got what they wanted, so she didn’t feel bad for anything.
Mr. Soleday, well she didn’t really know him.  Saw him at the gym once changing and was surprised by how ripped he was; he hid it under his jacket pretty well.  She put a few moves on him and likely said something along the lines of, ‘I bet those muscles are good for more than just moving weights’ but a firm ‘Fuck off’ stopped her cold.  Slightly pissed her off.  One or two other times they exchanged words and he became more hostile in his dismissals, so she stopped trying.
Being spurned turned some girls crazy, but not when it was that strong, she just shrugged it off with him and never really thought of him again.  The one disturbing thing was he was clearly older, probably about at least 30 on the Terra revised scale whereas Ryla was pretty much at the end of a sufficient adolescence at no older than 19, certainly not 20 as she didn’t feel like Ryla was that close to herself.  Why that perv was with someone barely older than half his age spoke strangely of both of them.  Not to say there were having sex – Feyria really hoped that wasn’t the case – but Ryla was naïve and Soldud felt like a rapist out of prison.  Hehehe, if he ever wanted a better assignment then he better stay away from the little girls that probably got him to a place like this.
She didn’t know the two in the back; she honestly hadn’t even seen that girl until recently.  The girl had a big gun, and nice long hair but other than that she was pretty forgettable.  She was the type that went to a dance and sat in the corner then cried herself to sleep when no guy went up to that wallflower.  She actually looked a lot better than her shyness and likely bad self-image portrayed her as.  She never felt any need to talk with her, but Feyria and that girl had the longest hair on base.  For being solid black, gun-girl’s hair looked very silky and shiny.
The guy next to her was some fire fighter; she didn’t know much other than he seemed a little dumb.  One of the muscle bound freaks that populated this base and lacked the roguish charm of her dear Kalco.  His face was all scarred up too; what, big dumb ape, forget to wear your mask in the fire?  Both her dear Madi and Rox really liked that idiot though.  She was always doing pull-ups on his arms and stuff in the gym.  She wondered if Rox found someone that would throw her down in the bedroom; seemed about all he could be good at.
Feyria faced forward again.  Right after, her eyes picked up a dark wisp in the distance, seeing it in person instead of on the screen.  Well, this might explain why Reiko-7 was not talking back.  She suspected there was more going on than the little she was told, but even after seeing the picture earlier she did not truly expect to see the base wrecked out like this.  She looked away from it, not wanting to fully embrace a seriousness she often did everything she could to avoid.
“…why people use two-handed weapons makes no sense to me,” Kalco was in the middle of some story.  Feyria didn’t mind; he was a war hero of sorts.  He never mentioned specifics but he had a vast store of tales about close calls.  A lot of inferior types would likely find him off-putting or arrogant, but that was a defense mechanism for their inferiority; Feyria found it attractive.  “It really only takes a few times of my life being saved, where my knife blocks an attack or kills someone while my pistol is doing the same to someone else that the idea of having both hands on a single item seems really…barbaric.”  He widened his eyes in emphasis as he grabbed Laina’s thick healthy leg and gave it a squeeze.  Laina had really nice legs; she spent a lot of time at the gym with weights.  Feyria really should do it more, but she preferred agility to strength.
Kalco was still talking, “Yeah this one right here,” he was pointing to a deep scar across his right cheek.  “If it wasn’t for Aelishun, my dashing face would be split in half on some desert…or maybe it was a jungle.” He laughed heartedly.  “Well, whatever!  They all kind of blur together!”
“Right…”  Laina rolled her eyes.
“Nah, for real, check this.”  He held up his highly customized pistol he named ‘Aelishun’ – perhaps in a near-back hand reference to the Aelisha race or Aelishan technology – as he continued.  “Line this shit up, it should be close with the cut on my pistol and my face.”
In front of Feyria she saw exactly why Reiko-7 had gone black, but Kalco’s antics amused her and she wanted to hear the end before she made a show of ‘telling’ Zaier and Kalco along with the others.  She slowed the V-Plane into a holding hover and turned around.
Laina was moving his pistol near where he was holding it.  “Hmm… Probably have to spin it slightly, let’s see.”  He held the pistol like he was holding it to shoot, then Feyria and Laina saw what he was talking about.
“Whoa…why did you never tell me this story?”  Laina traced the deep gouge on the advanced pistol that lined up perfectly with the angle across his face of the scar.  Feyria could only imagine what attack or creature had slashed at Kalco.  He blocked an attack that could have maimed or killed him, and he sat here laughing about it now.
“Too many other good ones!” he casually replied with a laugh.
“You like playing hero?” Feyria asked him.
“Playing?  Playing!?”  Kalco laughed at his feigned anger before replying in a normal tone, “Naturally.”
Feyria waved him up to the front.  “Alright then, ‘hero’. You and Zaier can come see for yourselves why we lost contact with Reiko-7.”  She hated this part; luckily she only had to do it for a short period.
Zaier was getting up out of the seat, “Why?”  He was good at playing a part like this.
Feyria leaned to the side as both of the males she was sleeping with stood next to her in the cockpit.  Out below them on the icy landscape were the blackened ruins of Reiko-7, small smoke columns slowly floating up the fairly calm winds.
Rather than focus on some base she didn’t know anyone at that had burnt down, she was thinking more if there was any way she could get the two of them together at the same time.  But for the sake of ‘professionalism’ she figured she should answer. “It’s destroyed,” she said dryly.  
“Yes, it is,” Zaier said, imperturbable as always.
Laina’s pulse quickened as reality of what they were stepping into was unfolding; she would be needed soon.  People’s lives may rely on her capable hands.  As they were landing, shattered ruins of their sister base rose out of the snow.  Laina’s heart cried out to any survivors that were still there, hanging on to a thread that she would restore.  Some that had been in her trade attributed a nihilistic ‘gods will’ to their efforts of who lived and died, but Laina did not.  
She looked down at her hands, the number four haunting her.  No, she saw all four mistakes quite clearly.  ‘God’, ‘Goddess’, or the ‘Line’ had not taken them, it was their own situation mixed with Laina’s inability to save them.  Their death was a weight she bore and a reminder to double her efforts lest it turn to five. 
Kalco’s hand gripped her thigh, giving her a friendly squeeze.  “Wow, some shit huh?” he asked her.  She smiled gently back to him.  He was confident and capable in his own way, that’s why they were a good couple.  But she was sure he did not bear a weight of some lapse of skills like she did.  She didn’t fault him for it.  Though she did not hate herself for not having the skills at the time, it was a weight she forever bore.
“I really hope they are still alive, but I am not sure how,” Laina said, hopeful but never unrealistic.  
“That’s why you are here, baby.”
Zaier stood up.  “Feyria does not see anything on the scanners, so whatever happened here appears to be gone.  I want extreme caution and stay near the plane until we have a better idea.  Laina, Kalco, you two are together.  I want you to give a quick look for survivors.  I’ll stay here with Ryla and monitor the situation.  Feyria, keep the plane ready.  The other five I want you to stay together and head towards the center of the base, and ultimately the command center and see what you can find.”
Zaier was holding up a standard Pulse Rifle to her, she shook her head no.  She already had a melee weapon she preferred, indicting the sword handle she had.  He had no problem with it and handed some of the rifles off to those behind the two of them.
Laina pulled her hood over as the cloth adjusted, expanding out then cinching around tighter over her face until only her eyes poked out.  The others did the same as the doors opened on the plane.  She was the first out as the cold frozen wind blew across the white wastes.  She was holding her medical bag, reaching down to her waist to make sure her tried and true Nano-Blade was still on her even though she knew it was there as she felt wary about the place.  She patted her left breast, feeling her vibro surgery scalpel where it always was.  That, along with a few other necessary tools like undifferentiated tissue, she could perform literal brain surgery.
There was a pat on her back.  She turned to see Kalco’s eyes from his own hooded coat.  “Come on, let’s see if there is anyone here to save.”
With the cloud cover around them and the light snow it made the scene darker than it normally would be.  On the ground was a permanent rolling snow caused by the flatness mixed with the harsh wind, causing drifts in certain areas to be taller than a person.  Laina used to really like the snow back home when it was seasonal.  A storm like this blowing in was a great time to bunker in and settle down.  It started grinding on her with the endlessness of it on Reiko.
The others behind them were getting off the plane and discussing a plan of what to do, but Laina and Kalco were partners and lovers and worked well together, thus didn’t need to be a part of their discussion.  They walked forward quickly towards the burnt out remains.  The base was not totally ruined, but for all intents it was not livable.  One Wing was completely burned out; another looked like an explosion had been detonated in it.
All the Reiko bases were constructed the same or a mirror image.  In this case it was a mirror, so the landing strip was ‘to the left’ side of the base, unlike 10’s which was on the right.  To both sides of them the Wings spread out as they walked towards the core of the ‘X’ shaped base.  
“What the hell is this?”  Kalco pointed with his pistol to a pile of black things off in a snow bank.  Short, twisted figures rose up out of the pile of snow, black and gangly.  The snow there was far different, as it looked like it had been formed up into a berm.  Nearby two large drums of fuel were on their side.  Kalco walked up and gave one a front kick.  It rolled slightly from the momentum as well as echoed with the hollow interior.  It hit a smaller metal crate that dumped something black out.
“Something fell out.  Ashes?”  Laina kicked her boot a bit at the ground.  She was surprised as there was more to the black than just what was in the crate.  As she dug it became clear there was something big that had been burned here, the solid ground she got down to was blackened in a wide circle.
“Why burn something when their base was burning down?” Kalco asked, getting closer to the black figures.  He started to bend down to touch it.
Laina reached out, grabbing his shoulder.  He turned to look at her questioningly, she shook her head no.  “We don’t know what it is.  It might be infectious.”
“Not much survives fire.”  She didn’t respond to his comment.  “Heh, medical people.”  He shrugged and stepped back.  Kalco switched to their Internal Communication System to talk to the others.  Got some really weird shit right outside the hangar entrance to the base.  Looks like a big bonfire where they burned something big while the base was burning down.
Laina shook her head to him.  “We don’t know the order that this happened.  This might have been before half the base burned.”
How do you know that? – Zaier asked over the ICS.
Because.  They dumped out two huge barrels of fuel and burnt something to the ground.  Kalco stepped forward, booting the backside of a different barrel, causing it to spin around in a half circle.  At the top, something innocently stated, but gruesome in its implication, was revealed.  
“Um…what the fuck is that?!” Kalco asked Laina, but the answer was pretty clear.  The top of the barrel as well as the side was splattered with blood.  The top had noticeable sections of skin ripped off on the edge in what sure seemed like a desperate attempt to open the container.
Laina did not like this.  They were not even inside and this strange totem on the edge of the base bore a dark prelude.
“Come on, there may be survivors.”  She grabbed his wrist and led him towards the doors.
He looked back once at the twisted figures in the burnt pile.  “Yeah, I hope so.  I got a lot of questions.”
The dual doors were normally automatic and opened when it detected someone on the outside, but there was no way that was happening here.  One door was crushed outward, and the other was slightly overlapping it.  Kalco squatted down and peered inside the hole.  Once he was content that it was clear he knelt down and lifted the door that, despite it weighing multiple times more than him, was easily lifted thanks to his Aelisha Genetic Engineered, combat-honed body.
“After you, my lady.”
Laina got down, shoved her bag through the larger hole then crawled in.  “Hang on,” she told him before he let it go.  She took a quick glance around and she found a piece of metal that she jammed into the opening.  “There we go. Now let it down slow.”  He lowered it, and the pipe was shorter than she would have liked but it cinched down and Kalco crawled through.  Once inside, they tapped once on their jacket and illumination came forth in the dark base.
“Hey!” Laina yelled.  “Anyone here?”  The only answer was the unnerving howl of wind through an opening or two of the once-sealed base.  “Hello?  We’re here to help!”
“Hardly recognizable.”  It was a grim statement.  Both knew quite clearly how the simplistic base was structured, but when everything was destroyed by what appeared to be an earthquake and a fire it was tough to know where to begin.  “Well, let’s go.”
“Wait,” Laina said.  There was something here she saw but it wasn’t registering.  She spun around to where she had pried the opening, and then it clicked.  Or maybe it clicked after the gashes and blood on the door were obvious in the light.
She knelt down, rubbing her finger over repeated cuts into the door.  “Hmm.”  She put three fingers onto three different cuts, stood up and leaned to where the other tilted half of the dual door was, her fingers lining up nearly perfectly.
“What’s it mean?” he asked.
Laina was good at anything relating to medical, but an indirect bonus was that she became good at piecing together disjointed timelines from clues, as it often was needed to make correct diagnoses.  “That whatever was striking the door, did it before these doors were blown apart.”
He nodded, steam rising up from his breath.  “Makes sense.  Think about this also: the doors were hit outwards, meaning that whatever happened occurred inside here,” Kalco stated.
Laina suddenly got an intense chill and her eyes watered for just a moment.  “Shit…”  She shook for a second.
“Whoa, are you okay?  Don’t think I ever heard you swear before.”
“Your comment gave me a flashback.  Growing up on Terra I used to read a lot of ghost stories and stuff, until I started scaring myself too much.”
Kalco scoffed, “What, you think ghosts did this?”
Shaking her head no, “No, this one story actually happened.  It was called the Dyatlov Pass incident, and it happened before the Sky Riots.  There was a group of students camping in some mountains, and they all died mysteriously.”
“And?”  Kalco wasn’t impressed.
Laina pointed a finger at him, “That’s not the scary part.  The scene after is what is creepy, and what it implies.  The people were found scattered all over the hillside, most without proper clothing for winter.  It was decently researched but no answer, sometime at night they had finished dinner and all settled into their tent for the night.  Something later had scared them so bad, they went running from their tent in absolute desperation, some without clothes, and died in various ways across the hillside.  They had to have known that outside without clothing they would die, but they were so panicked at something inside the tent that they cut themselves out of their tent to escape whatever it was.  They had to have known they would die outside, but apparently if they stayed inside they were dead for sure.
“The zipper on the tent was unused; they had just ripped out with knives or hands.  There was bunch of scary stuff like frozen flesh found on a tree someone was trying to climb and was ripping their hands trying to get up.  Some of the bodies were nearly naked in the storm, despite their tent being only a little distance away.  Bodies found near a small campfire not that far from the tent suggested on some level they were at least cognizant enough to make a fire but had no intention of returning to their tent.  Some girl had her eyes and tongue cut out, keep in mind this was like a high mountain area.  Some of the bodies had internal injuries but no major external trauma.
“The whole reason I bring this up is the similarity.  As a young girl it scared me so bad, what would be so scary, so dangerous that on a frozen mountain you cut your way out of your tent, and you die trying to climb a tree in the middle of the night, freezing the skin of your hands off?  Maybe like that barrel we found.”
The story got Kalco a little, “Damn, that is kind of scary.  I see the resemblance.  Normally these bases are designed to keep stuff out of it,” he pointed to the huge claw marks, “not keep something like that inside.  Did they figure out what happened?”
“Never.”  She shook her head.  “Anyway, I have a bad feeling.  Everything here is backwards.  I think you were right, maybe they were burning something while the base was on fire around them, and with this door, whatever happened here, someone was trying to get out.”
“Even if they knew they would die to the cold outside…”  Kalco was starting to understand the connection.
There was still light smoke inside the building, mixed with a stiff breeze from somewhere that caused snow drift eddies in the corners of rooms and destroyed objects.  
“Alpha and Delta are both burned out, doubt there is anyone there,” Kalco said.  Laina would not rest until they had actually checked, but knew the prognosis of anyone in either Wing was likely not good.  “The rest are going to the CC, and Bravo looks partially collapsed, so I say we hit Gamma.”
They headed deeper into the main room and then to their right, going to the bottom right of the ‘X’ shaped base towards Gamma wing.
The two of us are going to Gamma wing.  Alpha and Delta look destroyed and Bravo looks collapsed. – Kalco
That wing might be the dog pen, please check the dogs first. – Rox said back to them.
Laina did not know Rox that well, but she was a pretty friendly woman, clear lover of animals.  She’d seen Rox patch up one of their dogs pretty well once, so she knew a bit more than she let on in her raucous antics.  Even still, Laina was cautious of her; Laina had seen those ‘sand-bag’ types before.  They thought they were real clever hiding their skills and intellect behind a façade of ignorance.
The lights on their suits danced around, still fairly rhythmic and only the smallest additional bouncing suggested a worry to the couple.  Their lights stopped on the Delta wing door, still intact, with no blood, no gouges, hits or anything.
“If there are any survivors, they’d be in here.”  Kalco front kicked the door, his pistol ready, but he foot hit hard and nothing.  “Tsh, damn it.  Stand back.”  He readied a shoulder ram.
“Wait,” Laina cautioned as she walked forward.  When the automatic sensors were broken everyone would assume there would be no way to get the door open.  But Laina was pretty sure she’d seen this before.  She put her hand on the operating panel nearby and triggered a manual override, easily shifting the door out of the way on its backup tracks.  She turned to him giggling.  “Try before you pry!  Learned that one from Railine.  Or he says it anyway.  I still have to remind him all the time.”
“Right.”  He rolled his eyes.  “I learned this one from you.”  He pointed at his face as he sarcastically rolled his eyes a few more times.  “Besides I thought you didn’t like him.”
“He’s okay.  We have a weird tension between us is all.  He is reluctant to admit how much more I know than him medically given his generalist skill traits.”
She stopped and rubbed her gloved hand over a series of bullet holes in the wall.  This entire hallway was shot up badly.  In contrast to the dark ash of the central room, this hallway appeared normal, minus obvious bullet holes across multiple sections of the wall.  Laina thought that perhaps the whole base was shot up like this, but the holes were impossible to see against the black of the ash.
“Let’s get Rox’s dogs out of the way if they are alive,” Kalco said as they walked past a couple doors heading to the back where they would be kept if it was similar to their base.  At the door to the kennel he turned to her.  “Check this out.  Learned this trick from a cute girl once.”  He grabbed the override nearby and slid the door out of the way.  A lone unlit light hung on a naked cord that swayed in the wind within the room.  Inside the room the metal bars looked foreboding from the erratic light from their suits as they moved around, casting scary shadows on the back of the wall.  Fundamentally, though, there was nothing wrong here.  
“Hmm.”  Kalco strolled in, looking around.  “Well, whatever happened didn’t seem to happen here.  No bullet holes unlike the hallway.”
Laina interrupted him.  “You saw the holes?”
He laughed.  “Of course.”
“I didn’t think you were one for details…”
“Not usually, but I look for certain things, believe it or not.  Come on, those were so obvious, give me more credit.  How about did you notice a few energy weapon impacts in the first room, and the main hall?”  Laina did not, and shifted her eyes.  “You can always tell.  They leave an orange ring on metal like some, I don’t know, some super heat aftereffect.”
Kalco looked around a nearby desk and picked up a random object, studying it more than was typical for him.
“Look, someone was making this out of wood.”  He lifted up a small knife and pointed to shavings on the desk.
“What is it?”  She looked at the shape but couldn’t make it out.  “I don’t see anything.”
“You don’t?  It’s an angel, come on!  See, here’s her boobs,” he rubbed the statue suggestively, “here’s her long hair, these are her wings…as weird as they are…”  They did look like wings, but they angled off at sharp degrees.  Kalco was just screwing around, but on some level she wondered if he might have been right.  It did actually somewhat resemble an angel-like figure.  He laughed and put it down.
“Don’t want it?” Laina asked.
“No, it’s hot, but it kind of creeps me out.”
Laina shook her head at his antics and walked forward past him, opening the door to the dog pen.  She walked a few steps in and looked around.  It didn’t seem like there were any noticeable holes or anything.  She squatted down and looked at the dog food and the frozen water in their bowls.  There were no bodies of dogs, for that she was at least grateful.  
“This light really highlights your ass,” Kalco said, causing her to blush slightly.  He laughed at his own joke and stepped into the pen with her, kicking the frozen water bowl.  “You thinking what I am thinking here?”
She stood up.  “Probably.  The dogs didn’t die here, anyway.”
He shrugged.  “Who’s to say if they are even dead?  But think about what you did when you got in this room.”
She thought back to a few things.  “Open this door?”
“Right, and look.”  The door hung open, perhaps ominously to whatever he was getting at.
“What do you mean?” Laina asked.
“Door didn’t auto close.  So someone came and let the dogs out or took them out…and had enough time and presence of mind to close the door.”
That was surprisingly astute of him.  She wondered if he was actually ‘bad with details’.  For a moment she wondered if Kalco was ‘sand-bagging’ her to some extent.  “Good point, given how weird some of this other stuff is.  This seems to imply that the dogs were removed before it got really serious.”
He nodded.  Rox, no sign of the dogs here, but on the good side the room is in good shape.  Looks like they were taken away before whatever else happened.
Thanks for checking, I’m in Bravo right now… – Rox changed her ICS from group to just Kalco.  I’m with whoever that guard guy is, and the shy girl with the big gun.  They’re kind of weird, but I don’t really give a shit, there’s some weird stuff here.  Found a body with an axe in its back.  Another one, same deal, only it didn’t look Solarian.
What? – Kalco
Check it.  – Rox linked up a video her mind had recorded; Kalco linked Laina without letting Rox know.  The first video was a short discovery of the first body, sprawled out unceremoniously on a corner of the hallway, an axe deep into its spine.  The pool of blood had frozen the body onto the floor, but it looked like a male, despite a few hits to the head that were obvious as well.
The second looked almost the same, only it was a thinner frame – female based on the hips.  The light from Rox’s point of view only looked at the back until she looked to the right where the figure’s arm was.  It was burnt away to a black bone yet where her hand was supposed to be there was a giant blade or claw there instead.  In the video Rox jumped back when she saw it; Kalco and Laina felt nearly the same.
Be careful. – Kalco
Oh I will.  I’m more scared of these two trigger fingers I’m with, but you be careful out there too, Kalco. – Rox
“Well Ms. Medical, ever seen anything like that?” Kalco asked Laina once he ended the ICS connection.
Laina only shook her head.  They left the oddly serene dog pen to its frozen fate.
They headed to the  next room down the line when Kalco began, “Watch this cool trick!”  He went forward to open it, but Laina grabbed his wrist and threw it back.
“Something is on it.”
Kalco looked from her to the door and saw a light blue glass layer on the handle.  It looked like a variation of frost, but crystalline and three dimensions instead of only flat.
“I’d recommend not touching it.  Front kick it if you have to.”  He complied and hit it, but nothing happened.  “Hinges.”  She thought about telling him to shoot it off but he was already there.
Using my pistol to open a door, don’t be alarmed, he warned to the others through ICS. – Kalco
A moment later he had his custom pistol out and shot a couple areas of the door.  Kalco’s weapon was notable in that it was a large caliber pistol that shot actual rounds compared to most that used variations of energy.
He front kicked the door and it swayed on its axis, hung up on the top left before it fell inwards into the room.  At nearly the same time both Kalco and Laina reached out to stop the other from going forward.  They might have laughed at the similar motion but what they saw was too strange to bother laughing.
Inside the room looked like an illuminated ice sculpture display of sorts.  The glass panes were clear, but the whole room had a light blue or more rarely a purplish hue to it.  The entire room was covered in this icy structures, from the floor, to the walls, to the ceiling it appeared like they were anchored into it.
At the edge of her vision Laina kept seeing something, but when she’d turn it’d disappear.  Then she figured it out.  “Shut off your light.”  He listened to her, and in the darkness they expected instead they found a beauty where these crystals gave off a soft luminance.
Without lights, the entire room was still lit by its own internal source.  It was a soft night light feeling, there was a mystical aura to the place, and Laina was not one given to those types of feelings in general.
“Wow, that’s pretty cool.  Seriously beautiful, and I don’t use that word.”
Laina did not like what it implied though.  “Unnerving that it’s everywhere, like an infection.”
“Oh come on, infections are all green and gross and shit.  Maybe this is an art room.”
Laina had the feeling this was alive, or moving almost.  “Whoa…okay, that doesn’t look good.  Look at the door.”
The door he had kicked had fallen in and crashed onto some of the upward crystals.  Apparently they were not that hard as they had shattered from the impact.  “What do you…oh shit…”  As they watched, as slowly – or perhaps as quickly – as a small bug walking, lines were working their way on the edge of the door.  From these lines crystals slowly started forming upwards towards the sky.
“Eww…These things look pretty, but that doesn’t sit right with me.”
Laina stepped away and looked around in the hallway.  To the side were a few chairs thrown about.  She grabbed one, careful of her steps, and held the back as she touched one leg to the crystals.  She hardly touched one crystal and it snapped off, making a soft sound not unlike shattered panes.  She stepped back, holding the leg up to investigate.  What she saw didn’t need much comment.
“That’s…not normal.”
Laina was legitimately confused; it defied a lot of what she knew.  Even though the leg had only briefly touched the crystals, they watched as blue lines slowly crawled up the leg, the bare bones of the crystals forming.  Her mind reeled, and there was something she had to know.
“Get rid of that shit!” Kalco yelled.  She agreed, and leaned back to pitch it into the room when an idea hit her.  She balanced the chair, taking care to not touch anything, and with her other hand grasped her Nano-Blade.  With a flick of her wrist the weapon snapped out to full length, the nanites in the weapon activating and locking into place.  With a swift slash she cut the leg of the chair off, letting it fall into the crystal room that was very slowly leaking out into the hallway.  They watched and no new lines on the chair, apparently cutting off the leg of the chair had stopped the spread.
“Why’d you do that?” Kalco asked her.
“This acts like an infection.  I hate to use the term like that as it looks very geologic, yet reminds me a lot of cell cultures we would use back in school.  What I need to know is, is this a systemic condition, or local?  I need to see for sure.”
“What are you talking about?”  Kalco took a step away from the door.
“Look, the door and the leg are nearly taken over.”  Inside the room the soft blue and purple glow had now begun emanating from the backside of the door where the lines had all crossed.  “But this,” she lifted the chair again, “nothing yet.  Does it physically have to touch something or spread on it, or is it at the core of the object and it’s too late?  So far it appears the former.”
She knelt down, touching with her glove.  Holding the glove up, very slowly the crystals started spreading.  She took her glove off, dropping it into the room.
She reached into her medical bag, pulled a small vial out, then surprising Kalco, she touched one of the small crystals.  “Interesting, it’s warm.”
Kalco’s voice was hurried, “Should you be touching that?”
“It’s fine.  The skin is a good barrier, and along with nanites I am fine.”  She held up her finger, seeing the crystals slowly growing on it.
“Get that shit off, I really hope you didn’t just fuck yourself up.”
“Science Kalco, I don’t expect you to understand.  It’s okay, look.”  She scraped her finger off on an edge, rubbing it a few times.  She opened the vial, spraying it on her finger and it fizzed a little. She held her finger up to him like a proud little girl showing something off.  “See?”  She took her vial and sprayed some of the door frame.  The crystals withered under the spray, it was an odd feeling as it was sad seeing the small crystals dissolve.
“Eh, looks like you are okay, but what if you couldn’t scrape it off?”
“I’d cut my hand off.  It seemed conclusive with the chair.”  Kalco was surprised how evenly she said this.
“But the door now…” Kalco was not convinced, and his voice was wary.  The area where she had rubbed the warm crystals off on the door frame was ever so slowly expanding outward.  “You sure you are good?”  She held up her finger again and Kalco watch warily for a moment but it appeared it was not on her.  “God, some of the risks you take…and you told me not to touch the black things outside.”  He led them away from the crystal room.
 Laina followed him.  They both wondered – and perhaps regretted – if they somehow unleashed whatever was in here despite the slow rate it was spreading.
“It’s fine.  Now we know.  It doesn’t seem to affect us, and it’s not systemic; just a surface ‘infection’ if you even want to call it that.  Looks like standard sterilization chemicals work to at least some extent, odd as that is given their appearance.”
“Well, for your sake I hope that’s all it is, given how much you touched that shit.”
“Maybe, but it is worth the risk on some level.”
“I hate to ask, but if there was someone actually alive in there…”  Kalco paused, but it was too late to bail on the question, as the implication was obvious.  “Would you go in to save them?”
Laina stared at him straight in the eyes, without blinking once she answered, “Yes, I wouldn’t even think twice.”
Madigan stood over the bodies, the scene here matching the general desperation the other areas of the base had during their exploration.  He and Railine were the two in the deepest, most secure part of the base.  This location made what sure looked a final stand make a lot more sense.  Furniture had been turned over, piled, and lashed together forming a convex cone towards the door.  It looked essentially like a standing bunker.
The firing line was aimed at the door as the door had been blown apart.  Holes riddled the walls, and multiple energy weapon impacts were obvious in the prior room as well as all across the nearby wall.  This stuff made Madigan uneasy, and after seeing about the third arm or fourth leg strewn about the room, the hopelessness of whatever happened was rapidly rubbing off on him.
“Why the hell are we here?” Madigan asked his friend Railine.  Despite having different personalities, Madigan and Railine were similar in a lot of ways.  They were both physically fit, both good at mechanical aspects and repairs, and both intelligent.  Railine looked pretty battered from his past, and a lot automatically assumed he was stupid because he was strong and looked rough.  That was foolish of them, as Madigan had become quick friends when he found out his shop mate was surprisingly philosophical.  Madigan had read a lot of Intradex copies of books and understood some principles but had a hard time getting past the high degree of latent hate he held in his heart.  Madigan wanted to be philosophical as it might have helped him cope, but he never could get truly into it.  Unlike his spiritual friend Railine, Madigan felt nihilistic about life.
“I agree, I don’t like this.  Considering this base was supposedly online yesterday, whatever happened was fast.”
“Whatever it was could still be here.  I mean look at this…”  Madigan lifted his arm pointing to the bunker.  “Pretty clear they were ready to fight and…”
“And the evidence speaks for itself.”  Railine’s suit light was shining on the back wall where large sprays of blood had splashed, dripped, and frozen for all time.
“Hey, wait, what do you mean ‘supposedly’ online yesterday?”  Madigan asked at what Railine was getting at.
“Tough to explain…especially to someone like you.”  Railine’s last words were joking, but had an undercurrent of truth to them.
“Oh please.”  Madigan kicked at some piece of metal; it skated away before tinging into a wall.  The room was a complete wreck.  “You’re always talking about spirits and auras and all this and that, you are going to start pulling punches now?”
Railine laughed.  “I suppose it’d be a bad time to tell you I talk to dead people?  All this happening so fast…in what, a single night?  Doesn’t feel right.”
Madigan shrugged.  “Not sure what you’re saying.  Zaier or Ryla had comms with them up until last night.”
“And nothing strange?”
Madigan didn’t like where this was going.  Railine was not a suspicious person.  He had a good intuition so what was he going down this path for?
“Don’t know, man.”
As he turned to face his friend, the large muscular figure was obvious even under the advanced winter nanite coats they had on.  Railine spent a lot of time exercising, whereas Madigan did the bare minimum to maintain a prodigious strength he never had an interest in fully developing.  Railine always would go on and on about ‘you have great innate strength, if you really trained you’d be way stronger than me’.  Not interested, too mentally dull of an activity.
Forcefully, Railine asked, “Did you personally see that Ryla or Zaier were in communication with the base?”
“No.  Not my job.”  Madigan lifted his hand as if to wave away Railine’s point.  “I suppose I might be able to find out, but…comms is full of a bunch of girls and Zaier, not a place I want to go.  What are you saying?  You’re making me nervous, especially given the situation.”
“If I knew, I’d be honest with you, you know me well enough.”  He turned away.  “But something is not right here.  There is no way all this happened in a single night unless whatever it was is far worse than we can imagine.”
Madigan was engineered to have many talents, and contingency plans and alternatives were something he was skilled in.  “If you are trying to imply this didn’t happen in a night, I’d agree; but there are only two main options then, either someone in comms was lying, or they were getting a false feed.”
The tall body of Railine nodded thoughtfully.  “Hmm, yeah that was what I was getting at, if something like that was possible.”
“Easily.  It—Ah!”  Madigan let out a surprised cry as he stumbled.  He looked down to see what had tripped him up, regretting doing so as it was some indistinguishable body part that had frozen itself into place with its blood.  “Why didn’t I bring a better gun…?”  At this point Madigan had pulled the pulse rifle from out behind him, holding it up in front, toggling the flashlight on.  Railine kept his pulse rifle still slung behind his back.  “Why don’t you have your rifle out?”
Railine shrugged.  “Don’t see anything that needs shot.”  He didn’t say anything for a while then added, “There’s a few in the group with big guns here,” Railine mechanically responded to his friend, trying to piece together his version of what may have happened here.  “Ask them to come protect you.”
If Railine was looking, he’d have seen Madigan roll his eyes and shake his head.  “Right, a hotshot playboy soldier, a shy girl with the huge gun, and Solide.  I can only stand one of them.”  Madigan’s glove rolled over an energy impact on the wall.
The impact wasn’t right…it was incomplete.  He couldn’t piece it together.  It was as if the energy bolt had discharged part of its energy packet before the wall, but why had it not fried or killed whatever it hit?  He turned around, using the light of his rifle to quickly look for some burnt body near the wall, but there was nothing.
Railine was making a joke, “Yeah Aria is pretty interesting.  She’s the only one I like as well.”
Madigan sighed audibly.  “Please, don’t bring those bitches up, you know better.  I can’t stand most of them on this base.  Your friend seems okay only because she never talks, but even that’s a stretch.”
Railine was happy with that; from him that was a big deal.  “I know you don’t want to hear it, but in a touch of situational irony you and Aria are actually really alike.  I think you guys would be good friends, but I can see how it will never happen unfortunately.”
 “Yeah, real fucking unfortunate.”  Madigan was throwing some of the assembled bunker around with as much care as his sarcastic words implied.  He was looking for any clue or weapon as the bodies were making him uneasy.
“How you can stand Solide confuses me,” Railine went on, referring to the apparent one person Madigan could stand.  “His arrogance is like the others you dislike.” Railine was an introvert but talked openly with those he was close to.  “The only other person that can even stand being near him is little Ryla.  I don’t know her so I will refrain from any judgment, as her soul seems pure and is likely merely lost in a fog viewing him as perhaps some sort of older brother type.  As for him, I don’t like him.  He doesn’t have a good heart in him.  His intentions are dark, and I am not sure they can be righted by the light.”
Madigan came over, slapping his bigger friend on the shoulder.  “That’s why I like you.  You’re always preaching this voodoo shit that no one else gets.”  Madigan grabbed what looked like a table, shook it a few times to confirm if it was solid, and vaulted over the bunker to the other side.  He immediately regretted it once he saw the bodies and frozen blood everywhere.  How medical people dealt with this shit, he didn’t know.  Maybe it was some sort of inferior thought process that wasn’t bothered by facts that people had died here.  Maybe they liked working with a margin of error because if they screwed up the ‘biologic repair’ of a person they could shrug their shoulders like ‘Whelp, he was gunna die anyway!’  Yeah, that made the most sense, in general he was not impressed with medical types.  “Want to know the answer?  Solide hates these bitches too.  I can connect with someone like that.”
Railine felt bad for his friend.  He has his reasons but still… “He hates everyone from what I can tell.  He is not an enviable model for emulation.”
Madigan did not say anything back.  He had found something disturbing, “Damn, what happened that people did this?”
“What?”  Railine jumped over the table and walked up to Madigan, exhaling at it turned to steam rising above his hooded mouth and disappeared in the darkness above their lights.  “Oh…yeah that doesn’t bode well for continuation of life.”
There was a body that was kneeling and slumped forward into the cobbled structure, arms splayed out.  Dark, frozen liquid had pooled under him from the obvious kill wound of the massive battle axe cleaved deep into his spine.
“What the fuck, so they were shooting at something wielding an axe and it got through the bunker and firing line and killed this guy?”
Railine shook his head.  “No, you’re wrong.  It was a one hit kill, and this guy died looking forward, shooting at the door.”  Madigan was good at piecing things together, but perhaps a gruesome crime scene like this was better suited for Railine as it bothered Madigan too much.
From here it was a damn good shot at the door, and you could easily duck behind everything that had been put together.  It looked like a pretty good place to kill if it had to be done.  “So, what does that mean?  Clearly he didn’t see it coming.”  It was eerie seeing this frozen body that was ready to fight and yet was killed without a struggle so efficiently.
Railine said evenly with the calmness of someone that had seen a lot of dead bodies, “He was killed from behind.”
“By one of his own friends?!”
“If so, I wouldn’t call him a friend anymore.”  Railine almost laughed at the dark joke.  He had to censor that part of him a bit, as a lot didn’t get the morbid humor.  Laina was one of the few that did.  Railine went forward, grasping his gloves over the handle.
“Why are you touching that shit!?”  Madigan stepped back in surprise.  Railine pulled, and all that happened was he pulled the body, and it slipped and fell to the floor.  “God, gross as shit.”
Railine stepped on the body’s back, getting a better grip as he pried it out of the body.  There was a ripping and breaking sound as he ripped the axe out; Madigan really didn’t want to imagine what it was.  The axe was large, and the still frozen blood and pieces of flesh were enough that he looked away while Railine extolled its merit.  “Wow, really nice balance.”  He rolled it in his hands.  “Someone crafted this for battle, it’s way different than any fire or rescue axe.  I’d prefer this over the pulse rifle every time.”  He then offered it forward towards Madigan.  “You wanted a better weapon, here you go.”
“No thanks, I am sure there is an energy weapon around here somewhere.”  Poking around the bodies was grossing him out and was disappointed this was hard.  “Where the hell are all the guns?”
“Perhaps our axe wielder friend took them.”
“You got messed up tastes in friends.  In fact I think I’m your only guy friend, so clearly you have bad taste.  Too many fucking girls.”
“You sure you aren’t gay?”  Railine laughed with his friend.
“God I wish I was; it’d be so much easier.  Though I wouldn’t be surprised if you were stuck in the friend zone with every one of those girls you hang with.”  Madigan looked at the huge axe in Railine’s hands. “Are you seriously going to carry that shit around?”
Railine was kicking some of the body parts around.  “Either that or a rifle I don’t like.”
“Do you seriously have to kick every body part?”
“It’s your obsessive tendency that notices that in me.  Besides, we are looking for clues.”
“Yeah, here’s a clue.”  Madigan lifted his head studying bullet holes behind the defensive line “Some guy with an axe went crazy and killed his friends with the axe you currently are holding.  Can you put that shit down?”
Railine turned to look at his friend; only their two eyes looked out from the hooded coats.  “If you really want me to, but I’d feel safer if I kept it.  A good melee weapon like this suits my style far more than a projectile weapon, especially close quarters like in these bases.”
Madigan sighed.  “Whatever.”
“Ever seen these before?”  Railine was pointing to what looked like glass stuck in a body that was pinned to the wall.  Now that Madigan noticed it, he saw a few of those panes around on the ground too.  He walked over to one on the floor and smashed his boot; it shattered in a strange way.  It broke apart more than would be typical, fragmenting with thousands of lines, and it then turned into a pink vapor and disappeared.  
“Never seen that.  I’ve seen energy act that way on some vehicle weapons, where they have an unstable solid state, but no, never seen this,” Madigan replied.
Railine was now asking questions to Madigan about a subject he knew more about.  “So, this is some sort of energy weapon?  It’s like they were stabbed with glass, or cut apart and strewn out over the floor…like dolls instead of people.”
“Holy shit, do you have to describe what I quite clearly see?”
“Here’s something interesting…”  Railine kicked at an arm; it spun once and stopped.
“What?  Some guy’s arm?”
“No, probably a woman’s but that’s not the point.  There’s more arms than people here.”  Railine’s hooded figure turned around a few times to double check.  “Yeah, why are there more limbs than bodies here?”
“God, you would count something like that.  You do know we have two to one right?” Madigan responded, looking at the screens of the computers with blade hits and bullet holes.  He was not sure how much, if anything, he could salvage out of this.  He was the best for the job, but this place was wearing on him.  He had a bad feeling and long ago he had learned to trust his instincts.  
“Neither of us are dumb,” Railine said, letting the point sink a bit.  “There’s one, two, three…that’s probably the same one…probably same guy there, two on him, two her, that’s fifteenish.”
“ ‘Ish’.  I can’t believe we are counting arms.”  Madigan was patient.  His time among the stars would be soon, he just had to finish this one dumb little assignment here before he took his rightful place.
“So we are at six for sure bodies, but over fifteen arms.”  Railine peeked over the barrier, looking for anything he missed.  “When you do this stuff for a while you get a macabre view of the world.  Laina’s the same way, even worse.”
Madigan grew firm.  “Don’t mention girls around me, you know better.”
“Yeah, sorry, I knew better.”  Railine chuckled to himself only once, before his sympathy for his friend won over.
‘Those dumb bitches’ thought Madigan.  He controlled himself though so his record would remain immaculate and the starship future would remain his.  It was only a matter of time before he was through dealing with shit from girls who played up nearly any of the multitude of things he hated them for.  He especially hated Feyria; he could not stand that trifling bitch.  He’d fire her ass out of the airlock if she was on his future ship.
He pulled out his nano disassembler and programmed it for data recovery, pushing it towards a port of the computer before giving it some further instructions.  He’d let his friend play around with all the dead bodies, it didn’t interest him in the least.  The flowing nanite construct glowed a soft blue to let the operator know it was working as it locally powered the drives to hopefully record or download any information.  Likely a bunch of useless shit but he could filter through it later.
A new voice froze the two friends, “With only five bodies on this side, we have arrived at the setting of quite the mystery, haven’t we?”  Madigan whipped around to see Zaier.
When had he snuck in?  Zaier thought he was really smart and his obsession with power bothered Madigan.  It reminded Madigan of middle manager types with delusional visions of greatness, thinking that just because they have a little power and can order around some people that being a king or god is not fundamentally different.  They were the types that were stuck in that management position their whole life and each day never realizing the gulf between their delusion and reality.
Zaier was making a comment, “Something happened that they were torn apart, but the correct amount of bodies isn’t here.  It suggests they were moved, or perhaps the correct amount of bodies were never here from the beginning, if such a thing makes sense,” he smiled darkly at some reference only he understood.
Railine tightened up a bit, as did Madigan.  Railine was open with his friend, but fundamentally was introverted and wary of Zaier.  Madigan didn’t like Zaier’s cold arrogance, but did not mind how often he had backdoor insults directed at those around him if they were targeted at the girls.  Zaier liked results and that was something Madigan was capable of achieving, so in that regard was mostly left alone by him.
“Not much here,” Railine began.  “Huge battle but no real sign of anything.  There was this battle axe in this guy’s back that make it look like one of them attacked another, further there’re more arms than bodies”
Madigan then told him the things he had found, “The computers are all destroyed which looked somewhat purposefully.  We found a few things that look like Dimaglass panes that some people were killed with, and if you hit them hard enough they lose their solid state.  I’ve never seen a weapon like that.”
“Interesting.”  Zaier looked at Madigan, in a way Madigan had to laugh in his mind; he had a feeling each of them was looking at the other with disdain.  “Any chance you can get data from the computers?  They normally record almost everything.”
He pointed to the softly glowing light.  “Should be able to recover it easily, but it’s going to take time to process it back at base.”
Zaier walked over to a body near the door, lifting it up with his boot then kicked it fully over.  The face had dark markings like tattoos on both sides of it, going from the neck all the way to above to the eyebrow.  It looked angular and Strive-like but not quite.  “Can either of you two read Strives?  I never bothered.  Never was one for that slave language our race is subject to.”
“Some actually,” Railine said.  Railine had left the backside of the room, walking over.  “Those…aren’t Strives.”  Zaier’s eyes narrowed as he looked at Railine.  “I thought maybe it was Aelisha as they have them etched in a mirror image on both cheeks, whereas we bear ours only on our left.”  Railine lowered the point of the axe to point on the face.  “These patterns are on the neck and lower jaw, they are indeed etched into the skin like Aelishan ones are, but it’s a unique pattern on both sides.  Never seen markings that cover most of the face either, regardless, these are not Strives.”
“Just a tattoo or scar then.  Maybe I am over thinking it.”  Zaier moved around the room some, heading towards the back as hopped easily over the table after planting his left hand to vault.  “When you rip all the data, we are leaving, it is getting late.”  He was poking around behind the bunker, looked at the large blood splatter on the back wall for a moment then vaulted back to the original side.  He looked again at the female’s face with the dark markings for a while longer.  Zaier should have known at least a little about Strives, it was odd that he was looking so intently at the female’s face.  Without any other word, he turned and walked out.  
Railine gave a shrug and came back to the rear side of the room.  Back on Madigan’s side he was poking around through the makeshift bunker while waiting.  A soft light was blinking where Madigan was extracting data from one of the destroyed computers.  After a while Madigan asked, “So is his heart touched by light and redeemed through darkness or whatever too?”
“He carries a wounded heart like many here, one capable of light but self-imposed in darkness.  A familiar isolation of cold comforts his heart rather than face an uncertain road that could lead to salvation.”
“I think I got that in a fortune cookie once.”  The nanite tool beeped as Madigan turned around to grab the formed solid cube.  “Anyway, sounds like you are perfect friends for him, to help out his darkened heart and all that.”
“I’m only friends with people true to themselves.  It would take a lifetime for Zaier to redeem the pain he has placed over his soul.”
Madigan jumped over the wall that apparently was useless to the five complete dead bodies and however many missing bodies that decided to lose their arms here.  “This place is creeping me out, and your stuff isn’t helping, makes me jumpy, I’m tired of it.”
There was a huge crash behind him, and Madigan whirled around, trying to fumble for his rifle, only to see Railine rear back and swing downwards again, blowing through the defensive wall.  Swinging a few more times, he then kicked the wreckage out of the way casually so he could merely walk through.  “I was getting tired of jumping myself.”
“Damn, let me know when you do that,” Madigan warned as his heart pounded.  “I’m on edge around here.”
“Speaking of edges, I like this thing, finely tuned vibro edge, nice wedge falloff so it doesn’t get stuck, and great balance,” Railine commented nonchalantly.  He swung again at a different area and it crashed through everything easily.  That is until it surprisingly ‘tinged’ loudly off something, causing the axe to bounce away; judging by the shocked expression on Railine’s face, he clearly wasn’t expecting it to happen.
“What the hell was that?  Maybe your vibro edge isn’t that good…” Madigan said.
“No.  I hit something capable of resisting, that’s what’s strange.  Good edges are hard to stop.  Maybe it was an energy field or something.”  Railine started throwing stuff to the side.
“What are you doing digging in that junk?  Let’s get the hell out of here.”
“Help me.  Something that resisted a vibro edge shouldn’t be here.”
Madigan shook his head.  He really just wanted to get out of this place but figured he should help for a bit to find whatever stupid thing he was looking for.  It didn’t take very long as the stuff was cleaved apart right up to the object.
Railine lifted a heavy beam that was pinning the object further in.  “Well…what is it?” Railine asked.
Madigan wrapped his gloves around it, wiggling it back and forth until he pulled it out of where it was stashed inside the protective junk.  “Almost looks like a weapon…what the hell is it buried here for?”
He held it up as they studied it.  It was weapon-like in that there was a stock/butt, an approximate area to hold, and a long tube that perhaps rounds came out of.  But it was alien.  No question it was advanced with the sleek design, the soft, round edges, the forward sloping barrel.  In its silence it radiated a power beyond Solarian weapons.
“A gun?” Railine asked.
“Maybe.  Looks loosely like it.”
“Perhaps it’s our glass cannon that served some of these people up.”
Madigan gave him a sidelong glance, “Is that supposed to be some sort of pun?  Why is something like this here, and why was it buried?”  Madigan squared up, holding the butt to his shoulder.  “Stand back,” he warned.  He triggered his fingers on various areas where his hand naturally rested.  Railine braced for a stream of energy or something likewise to come out, but the only thing that happened was after a few moments both the men let out their breaths to the silent and cold room before the steam rapidly disappeared like all their other breaths.  “Broke?  Toy?  I don’t know, doesn’t appear to do anything, though.  I can bring it back and mess around with it a bit.  I like this thing.”
“I don’t.  Feels ominous,” Railine had taken a step away from him.
“What the hell, you grab some murderer’s bloody axe, yet are freaking out about some new energy weapon?  You should have been a witch doctor instead of a Damage Control guy.  This feels powerful if I can figure out how the fuck to turn it on.  Come on let’s get out of here.”
They walked out of the Command Center, towards a light from someone in the search party who swung the beam over them a few times before turning to leave the base.  “That’s why I like you Madigan, our outlooks are different but you are honest.  You don’t hide that you don’t like being here, and you don’t pretend to like people you don’t.  Honesty like that is refreshing.”
“Uh…you’re not the gay one hitting on me right?  You hang with all those girls, and I don’t think you are hooking up with any of them, not that I blame you for that.”
“There’re more things in heaven and earth, Madigan, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.”
“That from one of your books?”
He laughed to himself a moment before Railine put his arm around Madigan.  “Something like that, big buddy.”
Madigan pushed him off.  “I got this thing about being touched.” 
Railine laughed.  “Only by girls.”
“I don’t know, I’m starting to feel uneasy near you too.”
Railine laughed heartedly as they came back to main room.
“I’m surprised you didn’t ask me something,” Railine said, as they walked around a crumbled body.
“What?  This better not be about girls.  I seriously don’t want to talk about it.”
Railine was serious.  “You never asked if fire should have spread through here.”
Madigan stopped.  That’s true.  Most of this base was metal, sure some furniture was wood or wood-like, but why was nearly two whole wings torched?  “Good point,” Madigan admitted.  “Honestly didn’t think of it.  What’s the answer?”
“I don’t know, just surprised you didn’t ask!”  Railine laughed, even getting a little one out of Madigan.
There were back in the main room, about to leave the base behind.  “I just want out of this shithole.  I hope I never see this base again, and I hope I never see this planet again when I’m out of here.”  Madigan ducked under a pipe prying up the crushed-outward door.  Outside it was darker than before and the wind was picking up.  A storm was coming in, and they needed to be back before it hit.
Railine pointed over to at knocked over barrels that were pushed against a small hill of snow.  “Did you notice the frozen skin on these barrels?” Railine asked.
“I did the first time we came in.  I can care less.  I’m never looking at this shitty little base again.  I got a very short stint left and I’m full Captain after this.  I don’t need this drama, I don’t need the intrigue, and I don’t care if some guy went crazy in there and killed his friends.  I am off this shitty planet and off to the stars.  I don’t even want to think about anything other than my future.”  He paused a moment from his tirade before he turned to face Railine.  “Captains have a lot of pull, you interested in being my Damage Control guy?”
Railine was honored.  “I would most happily accept.”
For now Madigan would endure a few more of these insults, like being driven by an inferior pilot like Feyria.
Something was calling back to him from that base, something was watching him…No… he shook his head, fighting off some chills that were rising, he regained control.  He was not going to give into voodoo/magic/psychic shit; he was going to bite his tongue, endure his final set of cycles, and get the hell out of here.  He started to turn his head around but paused.  “No,” he whispered to himself, forcing himself to look forward and instead concentrate on the fact that he should be the one flying, and that stupid bitch should be the one fixing all the damage her recklessness always caused.
 
Zaier
Day-0, Night
Location: V-Plane returning to Reiko-10

Zaier stood outside waiting for the last two of the group before they would head back.  The headlights of the V-Plane lit as far as they could, but the crushing darkness and snow stopped the progress from getting very far.  At some point the cold had taken out the remaining heat of Reiko-7 and even if it had been daytime there would be no more smoke coming from here any longer.  That fact added a finality to the ravaging of Reiko-7 as it never again would be warm.
He was not too pleased with how long they had taken, yet given their task perhaps it was expected.  Kalco was a great soldier and Laina was a sufficient medical practitioner, and up until now he had little reason to doubt them.  
Zaier was the exact opposite of someone who would give in to panic or runaway thoughts, keeping an absolute iron grip over them.  Now though he could feel the stirrings of unease about the fact that they knew very little about this situation.  The facts were simple, but the conclusion was disturbing.  The entire base had been overrun, nearly burned down, and there was not a single survivor.  They did not find any hostile force that might have explained it, which in some ways was worse.  It was a mindless slaughter, and no indication of why it occurred.
The only hope was if they could extract anything from the information Madigan had taken from the CC that would have to be processed back at base.  Everyone had their stories of things seen at the destroyed base that lay beyond the veil of understanding.  There was nothing positive about the scattered bodies, the torched rooms, the busted up walls, the funeral pyres found in multiple locations.
Between bursts of snow, Zaier spotted two suit lights in the distance as the two remaining finally came back.
“We are leaving,” Zaier said through the face wrap, only seeing the staring eyes of Kalco as he went to turn.  Kalco always was defiant and had a thing for playing staring games, but Zaier had little patience for such supposedly ‘alpha’ shows of will.  He then caught the eyes of Laina and was about to look back at the ship when something made him pause for a moment.  The moment was notable, as he paused mid-turn, staring at the two of them.  Together the three were highlighted by the spotlight of the ship, standing in the growing storm, looking at each other’s eyes.  Laina had seen something she was not mentioning, it was obvious in her eyes; there was something important that had happened.  It was subtle enough she would deny it, but Zaier could not shake that something had changed in her.
It felt familiar but he could not place the thought as to why.
He turned quickly and merely filed it away.
On the ship it was much more sober than the boisterous ride out.  It was much clearer who was friends with whom.  Zaier did not care much about such things even if he was aware of it.  On fringe bases like this people came and went fairly regularly based on either punishments or rapid promotions for younger ones with potential like Ryla.
Heh…in a way if one looked at age – which of course was always up for interpretation given how easy it was to get augments – it was pretty highly correlated to their situations, whether they had messed up in their past or were on a fast track somewhere else.  People like Solide who were older completely radiated the aura and general feel of someone sent into a reformation program and packed into a base like this to be given a second chance.  To use the old revised Sol system, someone like Solide was at least late 20’s, and given his feel and likely face Re-con might be at least mid-30s.
“Damn, no one going to say anything?  So what, a few bodies shot up, no big deal,” Kalco said to the silence of the cabin.  He took his pistol out, spun it a few times, betraying perhaps a nervousness he actually felt.  “I saw that shit a lot in Daijin wars.  Whole squads would end up dead after a battle was over; I think the Daijins have some frequency that fucks up your mind or something.”
Zaier didn’t think that part was true, but left it as it might help calm some nerves.  Regardless, someone like Kalco was interesting to Zaier as to why he was here.  He was older, perhaps in the 28-32 year range – using old Terra terms – and skilled if even half his stories were true.  So why was he as a place like this?  Zaier also knew it was possible Kalco was some military plant for a mission, which would explain a lot.  
Though the age correlation was in general accurate, it was not the completely accurate, as Zaier was not young like Ryla, he had an immaculate service record, and was here simply as a type of cross training given to him on his way up in the ranks.  But Zaier was different as he was the commander of this base, not like Kalco or Solide. 
Feyria, is this ship capable of recording those whisper conversations in the back? – Zaier
Not really, but I could bug the comms in a way.  Want me to do it, babe? – Feyria
Yes.  I want to listen to them later.  There’s some people I don’t… Zaier thought about the word but decided to indeed use it …trust. – Zaier
Really?  Is there something wrong?  I think we are all a little stressed over how gruesome some of those stories we heard were.  I can come by and you can get all your anger out~ – Feyria
Zaier was not the type to completely forsake sex, but to a man of his cerebral caliber it was merely a side enjoyment; it was a thing that the intricacies of import others put on it was so much more fun to manipulate than to merely dominate or control females.  It helped clear his mind which was one of the larger benefits of it.  So the likes of Feyria proved fun to him to satisfy a sadist streak he was aware he had within him, and to see what level of depravity he could make her submit to rather than any actual sexual enjoyment.
All this being said, he was not sure there was time enough for love anymore.  His past as a soldier gave him abilities that kept him alive, and it was these things that left him wary.  Something had happened at Reiko-7 which was not normal, and the silence in the group spoke volumes.
I don’t trust Solide and Rox namely. – Zaier
Ah, what?  I get Sold, no one likes that asshole, but Rox?  She’s cute, fun.  Friend to all living things! – Feyria
Feyria either didn’t know or didn’t care to use Solide’s name that Zaier had heard her use wrongly before; he suspect that Solide snubbed her advance and that was a way of her ‘getting back’ at him.  Childish.  But most people were.
Feyria was capable of a lot.  Her piloting skill was evident, and athletically she was hard to match.  Her gymnastic performances in his room would leave many men and women jealous.  Not many women could balance on one leg doing what she did but to Zaier it was only sex and a temporary distraction.
She could rattle off about repairing things, or ‘thruster this’ ‘vector’ that, but he didn’t think she really had a thirst for knowledge.  Not many did.  She would be content with pacifying entertainment and not have a drive for improvement beyond her high baseline abilities.  He did not want to call her dumb as that was factually inaccurate, but for all intents it was correct; a lot of the people he was surrounded by were ‘dumb’.
There were a few present on this plane that were not like that though.  Rox was one.  For all her bristle and ‘I’m gonna kick all your asses!’ bluster there was an intelligence in her eyes that didn’t sit right with him.  It was a juxtaposition that wasn’t right for the wild girl others thought she was.
Railine was another one that stuck out to Zaier.  Not in that he was nervous about him, in truth he did not much like the man, but could respect a fellow seeker of truth if nothing else.  Maybe he didn’t like Railine because they represented similar results from vastly different paths.  It was something he tried to avoid thinking about despite how often he came back to it.   There was an uncanny valley of similarity between them despite the strict ranking difference that separated the two.
Last was Aria.  He’d seen the super shy girl type before.  Often it was that they were simply not intelligent enough, and on some level knew it and kept their stupidity to themselves gratefully.  Yet with her it was very strange.  She would look at him and would swear there was something important she was always about to say, as if she knew a truth she wanted to tell him…if she could ever bring herself to choke a word out of her mouth.
Hey Z, I have been pinging 10 for a while, and no answer on the strip.  Set down without clearance? –Feyria was now serious.
Of course, you know what to do.  
Why didn’t anyone copy a clear on the landing?  Zaier was looking out the dark window when he caught a fragment of a conversation in the back, “…what if it happens to us?”
He wanted to listen more, but the wind was picking up and the V-Plane was making more noise as it maintained its field around the craft, allowing it to plow through the atmosphere at a faster rate than merely blasting through air.
He learned forward, looking out the front and was glad to see glimpse of R-10’s light between breaks in the snow.  Did he expect different?  No…yet where did that panicked thought to check come from?  Heh…must be these idiots around him, their worry was leaking off.
Compared to the dead, smokeless Reiko-7, the lights – as cold as they seemed – felt like a welcoming womb to which they were returning to.  The energy fields repelling the snow on the landing strip were working fine as Feyria vertically landed and hovered the ship into the hangar.  
Silently everyone got up, grabbing additional things they had picked up in the dilapidated base.  Zaier was not opposed to the additional weapons some of them had grabbed, such as Madigan’s longer rifle-like weapon or the axe Railine had.  If it calmed them down, Zaier was okay with not saying anything despite the technicality that it was looting another base.
The hangar was cool, not directly heated as the base was, but insulated enough that someone wouldn’t freeze in there like they would in the actual exposed environment.  Zaier thought about that for a moment; if there was anyone left at Reiko-7 hiding somewhere they probably would not make it through the night.
A few lights hung above them, swaying slowly with the wind rocking the large structure.  The storm was increasing the sense of isolation, especially given the fear of what could have occurred at the other base.  Only the Gyro-Copter kept the V-Plane company in this building.  The two vehicles seemed insufficient against the hard pounding of the wind outside on the metal of the hangar.
No one spoke it, but secretly each person likely hoped Reiko-7 was some sort of isolated incident.
“I’m cold.  I’m going to take a hot ass shower, it’s been way too long,” Kalco began leading a procession out of the hangar.
“Way too many fucking bodies for me…  I hope I never have to deal with that shit again,” Madigan said to Railine.
Zaier waited for Feyria before the two of them followed after the rest.
Stepping through the slight energy field of the doorway put them outside in the harsh snow.  It was colder than Zaier remembered; was this normal?  He shook his head.  He was thinking way too much right now.  Some random base melted down, some people went stir crazy and had a rebellion, no need to get worked up.  That stuff happened when you had ‘redeem’ crews like some of Zaier’s people here.  Just a long hot shower, followed by a long hot session with Feyria…He didn’t know if he really had it in him tonight, so maybe he’d just let her run the show.
They walked through the door that led to the armory.  Railine had finished cleaning the axe in a big slop sink and walking over to put the axe into his locker.  Ryla was taking off part of her heavy coat while she sat on a bench, and the rest were putting rifles away or talking off their boots.
Zaier had too much to think about and was going straight to his room.  He threw the rifle down on a bench where some others had been placed.  It was late now, but the base seemed like it was quieter than normal.  Zaier walked into the large open room and instantly realized with a grim knowledge that the nightmare he hoped to leave behind had somehow followed him back here.  Something had changed when he was gone.  The entire room was empty, and there was no sound anywhere.  Even during night, there were people active.  Had whatever happened at Reiko-7 had made its way here?  No, he couldn’t jump to conclusions; the base was still in pristine condition.
Zaier stood there silently, trying to assess the situation when the next person behind him broke the calm he was trying to maintain.
“Holy shit…” Kalco began.
Feyria said what was simple, but summed up their problem so easily.  “Where is everyone?”
“Just sleeping,” Madigan said forcefully, it was easy to tell it was mostly to convince himself.  “Hey…hey!  Anyone here?” Madigan yelled, running down the Alpha wing towards the workshop where he spent the majority of his time.
Rox had come out into the main room now, the four of them saying nothing, each secretly hoping the silence was just some odd coincidence.  They heard barking in the distance.  “The dogs!”  Rox cried.  “Something might be happening!”
The three present ran with her towards the barking.  Things were spiraling in a way that Zaier was having a hard time understanding how this had happened.  When he did not even know what had happened, the how was impossible.
Zaier’s hand went down to his waist, snapping up his knife; he was glad Kalco still had his custom weapon.  Rox threw the door open of the dog kennel.  “Rhett!”  A big dog similar to a German Shepard ran forward and jumped up, licking her.  “Rex, Ricochet!”  She called the other two and they spilled out, running over to the group of Solarians, wagging their tail and licking with reckless abandon.  “Something scared them…they are glad we’re here,” Rox said definitively.
Everyone sighed.  Maybe something was just going on and they were jumping to conclusions.  The dogs were fine, so what else was wrong?
A voice froze them part from surprise and part from what the words contained.  “Beta wing is empty,” Solide stated steadily.
“No way,” Zaier said.  It was more to himself than Solide.
“I am not lying.”
Zaier looked to Kalco.  “Check Delta, I want you back in the CC after a fast sweep.  Feyria, check Gamma.  Solide find Madigan, he went down Alpha, so check there.  Rox grab the rest, we are going to the Command Center.  This has to be recorded, no way everyone just disappears.”  All of them trotted off with hurried cadence.
Zaier walked into the main room, trying to maintain normalcy, but was conscious of it feeling forced; his steps were just a bit too fast.  There was an impatience in how easy this would be to solve, and a sense of gratitude to put this panic behind everyone.  Merely pull up any video and rewind a bit.
At the CC he swung his fingers around, reversing the apparent flow of time on the video.
“Where is everyone?” Ryla asked, coming in with the main part of the crew.  She had missed the recent revelations.  The dogs had followed them in here, and normally Zaier would yell at Rox to get them out of a sensitive place like this, but right now…  He pressed the rewind faster.  Where were these fuckers?
The darkness of the halls grew lighter as the reversing image showed the light coming in; he continued going further and further back.  Movement.
“There…”  He slowed.  It was the back of someone merely walking out of the view.  Okay, at least someone was around somewhere.
“Ryla, help pull up a recent vid, find me a good video of someone.”
Zaier went back to it, not explaining to the waiting people behind him.
It was not that they couldn’t find anything but the videos were just so woefully inadequate.  It was odd for that fact alone, as if somehow the rest of the people on the base were purposely avoiding the cameras.
“Hey, got one.”  They all looked to Ryla where she was playing a video of a group of about four or five people who…to say it quite simply, walked straight out the front door.  There was nothing out that door, except an emergency cache of supplies further away in a small bunker.  An abandoned mine also was that direction, but it was very, very far away without a vehicle and not a likely destination.  
“Why are they just leaving?” Laina asked.  That was a good question.  In one base something happened that they killed each other, now here marching off into the snow.
“Maybe this is some military experiment we are subject to,” Railine suggested, “different things that affect the mind, targeting each base with some unique virus in the brain.”
“Not sure it would work like that,” Laina said to him.
Zaier ran his fingers over, doing what should have been done right away, activating a scan and map of the base.  The large X-shape of the base appeared on the screen.  To the right was the hangar, and a few other structures dotted the landscape nearby like an old shack, the emergency supply cache, an explosive storage, and the fusion reactor to the left.  Blue dots showed the four vehicles the base currently possessed.  There was an orange dot he assumed was Kalco bouncing between rooms and two others that must have been Solide finding Madigan at the workshop.  In the Command Center were seven dots along with three red dots to signify the dogs.
‘The rest.’ He thought to himself.
“Seven, eight…nine…ten…”  Feyria was pointing with her finger.
“There are only ten of us left,” Zaier stated for anyone that did not understand what was going on.
Things started clicking in his mind.  He wasn’t here because this was just another step in his Leader track.  No he was here because his past and whoever or whatever put him here knew what was going to happen, either subjecting him to some experiment, or if something even worse was happening.  Zaier took comfort in seeing things before they occurred, but something else saw this from a long way off.  Something bad had happened here at Reiko-10, no something bad was occurring on the entire planet of Reiko.
He considered the nine people remaining with him but it only made things worse.  He wondered if any of them were innocent or how many may have known what was actually occurring.  Sighing, he rubbed his eyes briefly, it was subconscious initially, but catching the lack of control he smiled at himself.  Pulling his hand down, he thought, ‘The situation is even getting to me.’
 
Ryla
Day-1, Morning
Location: Reiko-10, Weapons Locker

Predictably no one had dared to try to go to sleep and it was finally almost daytime.  For Ryla it was always the most depressing when the light of the next morning was first coming up and realized she had been up all night.  She had found herself in the Weapons Locker despite being opposed to violence, the place had a disheveled look as people had rooted out various gear without any desire to put it back.  She brought herself back into the central open room where others were gathering.
During the night a few more walks had been conducted through the base, and even a quick patrol in the Armored Personnel Carrier driving through the snow, it was clear that there was no one else around.  The blizzard annihilated any remote evidence of footprints and only helped the feeling of isolation.  Ryla had poured over the comms all night to no avail and Madigan’s data from Reiko-7 would take longer to process.  The thing that was interesting was that there were many unusual readings from remote locations she had never seen before including the abandoned mine and brought it to Zaier who noted grimly that they may warrant checking out.
Ryla felt very unprepared for the serious situation unveiling here.  No one had any idea what was occurring but unlike her, they seemed prepared in different ways, whether it was Zaier or Laina’s natural intellect, or just the pure strength of Kalco or Solide.  Feyria and Rox were always confident, Madigan was skilled, Railine was always calm.  She didn’t know Aria well, and might be the most similar to her, but didn’t have the feeling she doubted her skills like Ryla did.
Zaier was talking, “…what I suggest is a splitting up as there are a few different potential things to investigate.  We do not have comms with any of the other bases because…”  Zaier’s normally intense face changed to confusion as he locked onto something behind them, causing a few to turn around slowly.
Kalco was the first to speak.  “What the fuck…?”
Not far from Ryla was what she thought was another women.  Phewww…She felt relief for a moment.  Maybe it was all a big misunderstanding.  Yeah…any moment everyone would be back and this was just some drill and that’s why Zaier was with them to measure their performance.  Yeah then—
Ryla’s daydreaming was interrupted as this woman-like figured dashed with a surprising speed at the nearest person…who happened to be her.  She gasped and screamed for a moment before her body reflexively dove to the side as a bone or disfigured hand slashed at her location.
BLAM BLAM BLAM!  Three loud bangs shot out.  The figure staggered for a moment, and turned its head in a jerky way right at Ryla; the look froze her.  Its body looked very humanoid along with the woman’s face; the only major difference was what looked like some distorted set of wings behind her body.  It had such a sad, lost look to it, the eyes empty and betrayed.  On her face was some sort of markings or scars.  It was as if this thing was asking Ryla to explain her own crimes of existing.  Then…
BOOM!  A piece of her head was blown off with what looked like blue steam as it rapidly dissolved as it rose and she dropped solidly to the floor.  Ryla turned to the right to see Solide one-handing his shotgun at the creature.
In the forced silence the few that had weapons brandished them in front of them.  Most were knives, or standard Pulse Rifles, excluding the large axe Railine had.
“Uh…what the FUCK was that?” Madigan asked as everyone stood there silently, weapons hanging in the air.
Solide crept forward.  The body twitched and he unloaded another shell into it, splattering gore on the back wall of the room; there was little left of this thing at this point.
Ryla stood there frozen, tears coming down her face.  A hand clasped her shoulder, causing her to cry out as she spun around.  It was Kalco, and despite his chance for jokes he seriously asked, “You okay?”
She nodded and began crying, overwhelmed by the reality that she was so inferior to these hardened men and women around her.  He rubbed her shoulder comfortingly.  Hey don’t cry, we killed it.”  He had no idea why she was crying.
Laina came over, holding Ryla to her chest.  “It’s okay, you are safe.  We are all in this together.  I know it can be scary, but no one is hurt, we are going to get through this together.”  Laina pulled away, rubbing Ryla’s arm, “Can you be tough for us for a little?”  Ryla nodded.
Laina walked up to the body, bending down and looking at it.  Ryla did not know Laina that well, but she seemed like she had a strong maternal feel to her.  She seemed older and wiser than her actual age, the caring mom of the group.
“Should you be that close?” Railine asked.
“How can I investigate if not?”
Zaier walked over, not bending down though.  “Female face…partly.”
“Yeah partly.  It got blown the hell away,” Madigan said.
“Beyond that.”
Ryla wiped her tears.  Kalco nodded to her and the two walked over to the body.  She kept a much greater distance but even from here it was disturbing, and that wasn’t because of the bullet holes through the chest or the missing head.  Half of her looked like a normal young woman who was in good shape.  If you only saw this part of the body one would think Solide had just killed a star athlete with how fit it looked.  The more Ryla looked though, the more disturbing it was.  Her right arm was gone at about the elbow, replaced by what looked like a…bony claw?
Her stomach looked torn into but scarred over; only the tearing of the cloth brought attention to it.  Her face had a similar look where it appeared as if someone’s hand had gotten under her skin and ripped part of her face off, leaving aspects of bone.  Strangely on this side were lines and patterns vaguely Strive like, but larger and more complicated.  The entire countenance felt very ‘two faced’ in the fact it looked like a cute girl on one side, the other marred by the tribal tattoos and torn apart.
Ryla heard whispering to her side, “Hey, that’s that same shit we saw on the face of that one body at Seven…” Madigan was whispering to Railine.  Railine gave him a quick elbow and he shut up.
“What the hell is that metal stabbed in her?”  Kalco asked.
Laina was pulling on what looked like two rods that were jammed into her back side with pieces of neon colored metal hanging off of it.  “Hmm, really interesting.  It is as if this is part of her.”  Ryla thought they looked like wings almost, or at least some sort of demonic half-attempt at them.  They clearly couldn’t be wings since they didn’t look solid enough for flight, but it still added to the disturbing visage.
“I never seen her before,” Kalco said.  He turned to Madigan, “How about you, big boy?”
“Fuck off.”
“No, she was not one of ours,” Zaier said as others turned to him.  “I am good with faces and I know who our current crew is.”
Ryla was actually pretty sure the face looked like someone on the medical crew.  She looked to Laina to correct Zaier but she did not.  It made Ryla question if the face was really someone she recognized; if neither of them said anything, maybe she was wrong.
“Who, or what, is she?” Feyria asked.  “Is this what happened at Seven?”
“Not sure, maybe.  We didn’t see any bodies here at all,” Zaier answered her.  Most had stepped a comfortable distance away from the body, only Laina and Railine were near it.  “I saw something similar on her face at Seven,” Zaier was cut off when Laina stood up and asked a question.
“Here’s something odd, did not one else notice something about this body?”  She turned to Railine, then Aria.  “Not going to say anything, Railine?  Or you, Aria?”
“I’m decent but you know way more than me,” Railine replied.  “I thought it was maybe something xeno and was deferring to you.  I saw right away though.”
“I saw,” Aria shortly stated.
“Tell us,” Zaier said.
She pointed to the body triumphantly “No blood.”
“Oh yeah…there should be a pool of it,” Feyria noticed.
Ryla felt nausea on the brink of coming up.  She hated violence, so many people rushed to it so fast.
“Bodies hold a lot more blood than we might normally think,” Rox added.
Kalco shrugged.  “I think you are over thinking this Laina.  I’ll spare you the ballistics jargon but my rounds cause cavitation waves as the damage path.  The actual rounds themselves thermally burn so they generally seal the wound.”  No one immediately understood him so he explained further.  “I’ve shot people who died but basically they didn’t bleed at all.”
“Cauterized the wound…”  Laina had a hand on her chin as she nodded.  “Makes sense.  Guess I am over-thinking it after all.”
“Energy weapons never bleed bodies,” Madigan offered as explanation.
“Mine aren’t,” Solide said, letting his words hang, but no one knew what that meant.
“Hmm?” Zaier questioned.
He held out his shotgun, holding it midway down the barrel as if presenting evidence of a crime.  “High end ballistics only, nothing special, nothing fancy, little miss devil bitch over there should be bleeding like a stuck pig, but not even her brain leaked out.”
Breaking away from the group, Ryla staggered a few steps as she started throwing up in the corner.  Rox came over, resting a hand on her back.  “It’s okay, these guys are crude as hell.”  Ryla stood up and felt dizzy.  Rox took her in a one-arm hug and rocked her gently.  “This is stressful for all of us.”
Crying, she answered back, “I’m just so overwhelmed, everyone else is so calm.”  She gasped a few times between tears.  “Even you are tough and cool and not worried at all.”
Rox laughed.  “Let me tell you something, most of them are just good at hiding it is all.”  Rox pulled her a bit further away, whispering to her.  “Look, Madigan taps his fingers on his leg, Kalco spins his pistol the other way, Feyria plays with her hair down by her waist when she’s scared…”  Ryla did indeed see these small nervous twitches now it was pointed out.  Rox slapped her back lightly a few times.  “Come on, I know you are a tough girl.  We’re in for a long haul here.  I know you can do this, let’s go.”  Ryla nodded, swallowing her tears, feeling more brave simply having a tough girl like Rox believe in her.  “Would it help if I told you that I think you were the type that could save us all?”
Sniffling, Ryla shook her head ‘no’.  “Nowhere close to true.”  That was an odd statement out of the woman, a weird way to try to cheer up Ryla.
Rox laughed.  “I’m sure you have some pretty tough ancestors, prey to them.”
“But I don’t…”
Rox held a finger up to her mouth as if to quiet her, giving her a single wink.  “Maybe eventually we will all see your strength that is so clear to me.”
Ryla was touched that a rough girl like Rox had a soft side and actually believed in Ryla, even if she didn’t believe in herself given how serious this was here.
“Come over here,” Zaier said to them.  Ryla wiped her eyes and Rox tugged her and with a firm nod they walked back to the group.  “We have the following situation: an unknown force has wiped out Reiko-7 and either hit here, or hit here in some sort of modified capacity.  What that creature was I have no idea but it makes sense to me that might be partly what happened to Seven.”
Zaier continued on, “It seems to be melee focused so we may take a lesson from our sister base and consider making some fortifications inside here, this room being perfect to at least slow them down.”
“Why the fuck are we letting them in here?” Solide asked.
“No one let this one in,” Zaier answered.
“The doors are on auto,” Madigan offered.
“Shut that shit off,” Solide said.
“It would be easy enough, but I don’t doubt that the doors could be broken down easy by that…thing,” Madigan responded.  “If that was what caused the damage at Seven, it might be to our advantage to leave the doors on auto and just shoot them.”
“So we just let the fuckers waltz the fuck in?”
Madigan argued back with him, “The alternative is they destroy their way in, and then we deal with the heat loss out the doors.”
Heat was a very real issue on this planet.  Not being in a vehicle or building would kill someone sooner rather than later even with their advanced suits.
Solide shook his head in frustration.  “This fucking place…Unbelievable I got stuck on this shit.”
Zaier began laying out a strategy, “We are limited on people, so while I would love to have someone stationed at every door there are seven total entrances, three of which are directly off this room and the four from the wings.  It seems tactically obvious that localizing our forces here is better at the risk of losing anyone on the periphery.”
Kalco said in a tone that was not his typical braggart one, “Interesting assessment on tactics there, Commander.”
Zaier looked back at him; his longer dark hair framed his face in a way that added to his coldness.  “What are you saying?”
“Nothing, nothing.  I’m going to say yet anyway.  But I do believe that is actually a decent tactic.”
Zaier was angry.  On a lesser man their face would have been red; Ryla only knew it because she worked with him.  “What are you implying, Kalco?  You need to watch your mouth with spurious statements like that,” Zaier said strongly back to him.
Kalco took his pistol out and spun it around a few times.  “Hey, I said I liked the tactics.”
“Are your insinuations how you plan to break the team moral apart?  Do you want us to end up like Seven?” Zaier was speaking forcefully.  “Don’t ever start questioning me again.”
Kalco stopping spinning his pistol, “Or what?”
“Stop it!” Rox yelled.
Zaier slowly tore his gaze away from Kalco.  “I suggest a trip to the armory or any of the stores to grab some equipment.  At this point any accountability to anyone off planet is gone so I trust your personal judgment of what you think is appropriate as far as freely taking from the stores.  I want to start getting a bunker built in this central room, it will defend both the Command Center as well as be able to react to most of the base.
Zaier was still talking, “Ryla had picked up some interesting readings on the map of locations that we never had energy signatures from before.  It’s impossible to not think it is related.  After we get this base secured, I think it is in our interest to have a small team check these out.”
“So what are you saying?  Leave our base to go check?” Ryla asked him.
“Quite frankly, yes.”  There was some shuffling and general unease but no one spoke up directly.  “Seven was no different than us, and their defenses, strategy, willpower, thoughts; everything was worthless as they fell to whatever this is.  A majority of our base staff is already gone.  We are lucky that at this point there is no damage, but what if everyone who was here is…”  A dog was whining and it came up to Zaier, causing him to trail off as he bent down slightly to scratch it by the ear.  “Hey, good boy, Rex.”
“That’s Rhett,” Rox corrected him.
“What if everyone missing is now one of those things?  Do we stand a chance?  Kalco and Solide have a demonstrated proficiency in weapons and that was one creature and it was still a close call.”
“Zaier, I don’t get what you’re saying,” Feyria said.
“We do not know what happened, and there are no answers here.  We have at least something on the sensors.  I fully admit that it could be a trap, suicidal, or something similar.  But we lose if we hole up here.  We have Seven to thank for that example.”
Ryla spoke up, sad with that last statement.  “But this…was our home.”
“I am not saying we abandon it.  We have ten of us and the dogs.  I suggest a small group investigates these locations we picked up.  We can do a flyover and if it looks dangerous we don’t go in.  It’s the only lead we have.  It is my decision, so I will go.  I need a pilot so we can get there faster and be in air.
“I’ll go.” Feyria said.  In a surprising turn, Feyria was serious rather than flirtatious.  “I…would not feel safe if I wasn’t with you.”
“You’ll need a backup pilot…so that’s me, as much as I don’t want to go,” Madigan said.
Feyria smiled.  “Thanks.”
“We need a fighter too,” Zaier commented.  “Kalco you are coming.”  Kalco spun his pistol the other way a few times, only nodding once.  Kalco laughed to himself softly.
“And what if your little plan goes bad?” Solide asked.  “You have two of the pilots left,” he pointed out as he looked around.  “Believe it or not I know a little about flying Gyro-copters, but that’s just one person, and we have no one else for the V-Plane.”
Feyria nodded towards Ryla.  “Ryla can!  Besides, we will have the V-Plane so that won’t matter for you, but she’s still capable!”
“How is that supposed to make them feel better…?”  Madigan muttered.
In her heart that was way too much faith in her.  She had only taken a few lessons from Feyria.  Ryla shook her head no rapidly.  “Uh, no…I really can’t.”
Zaier continued before there was too much argument, “The rest of you stay here.  We do not know what is going to happen.  I am leaving Rox in command.” 
“That bitch!?” Solide shouted in disbelief.
“Yes ‘that bitch’!” Rox yelled back to him.  “You got a problem with me, jackass?”  She walked over to him in a clear intention to fight.
“Yeah, you are worthless slut, as dirty as those damn dogs.”
She pushed him hard.  “Take that back you bastard!”
“Touch me again and die, cunt.”
She obliged.  “Fight me, asshole!”  As soon as she touched him he was swinging his left fist towards her face.  She barely moved out of the way but the momentum carried him through enough that he somewhat fell on top of her.  They started wrestling, screaming and yelling at each other.  Both were landing solid hits on each other in the ground scuffle.
“Stop fighting!” Ryla pleaded
“Stop them,” Zaier said firmly.  Railine, Madigan, and Kalco moved in, and really without the three of them it might have been impossible to stop.  It took two of the guys on Solide and Railine was holding Rox as she was thrashing around saying she was going to kill him.  Solide said the same, but much more crudely.
The two of them were still held by the three men as Zaier walked up and slapped Rox across the face hard before turning and backhanding Solide.  “If I ever see that out of either of you two again, I am going to shoot you myself.  Is that completely clear?”
Solide looked away and Rox mumbled.
“Is that clear?” Zaier raised his voice ever so slightly.
Both said yes in a way to show their displeasure but not to incite punishment.
“In the effort to avoid conflict I am instead leaving Railine in command.  I doubt anyone has a problem with someone more even tempered.  It is just about daytime, and our battle for our life begins in earnest!”  Zaier laughed as he walked away.
A dark thought came to Ryla and she wondered if Zaier was running.  Everyone here had saw what happened at Seven.  There was no mistaking that everyone there had died, many in an extremely gruesome fashion as they were torn apart and scattered across the floor.  Reiko-10 had something vaguely similar in that everyone was gone, and some mutated woman – whom Ryla swore looked like someone on the medical team– had already attacked them.
The thought was, what if Zaier knew this, and was evacuating?  The life boat was leaving, and Ryla was not part of it.  He had his pilot, his back up pilot, and his personal guard.  Ryla was being left behind with those he had no use for; on the off chance they may be able to save the base.
Ryla thought they were friends, but when the chips were down, Zaier though Ryla was not good enough to go with him.  In some ways he was right, but in some ways he was way wrong.
Ryla started crying again.  It was not even a single day and they were falling apart and at each other’s throat.  Rox thought Ryla was strong, but she was wrong, as Ryla was weak when it came to violence, she was the weakest here, easily.
She could see how events could quickly make them being their own worst enemy but she could do nothing to stop it.  This time no one bothered consoling Ryla as she was crying.  Perhaps they thought it was better if she just left them all alone and went outside to die like the other’s had done previously at this base.  Sad how quick people were to judge on appearance.
Some of the guys began throwing some furniture down, dragging around and forming some barricades.  There was a respectful distance given to the dead creature but quickly the room went from a central meeting area to a rough bunker.  As Ryla watched she noticed that some people had more weapons than before or were equipped with some light armor that they picked up.  That was prudent certainly, but Ryla could not touch a weapon even if it meant her being killed here.
So quickly everyone acted as if it was now normal to walk around with slung rifles and pistols, talking with body armor on.  Reiko’s new normal was something she was not ready for.
Were they always this way towards each other?  Had something changed so fast?  This was not normal…but what was?  She was a broken girl, so she certainly did not know.  She had too much hate and regret in her heart to see many things clearly, of that she was at least positive.
Before long the bunker looked like it could actually be useful as a defensive barrier.  Zaier gave some more commands about what they were doing, and helped bring more supplies to those staying behind.  But Ryla could not let go of the ‘left behind’ feeling and eventually when the V-Plane left with four of them and she was not on it, the reality was slowly becoming undeniable.
 
Railine
Day-1, Midday
Location: Reiko-10, bunkered center room 

*Boom!*
The shock hit everyone around them twice.  One was the physical shockwave of a weapon being fired; the second was the emotional shock of being betrayed.  It took a few moments for the physical reactions to kick in, which was coincidentally as long as it took for Rox’s body to react, as it was still standing with the right side of her face missing.  Solide wasted zero time pumping another shell through her body, exploding flesh into the back wall that sent her body down.
“No…way…”  Railine stood stunned, the axe he had brought back from Reiko-7 ready to go as the blood from Rox’s body was slowly dripping onto the floor.  His mind was reeling, trying to process a cacophony of various inputs: SHOT, ROX, DEAD, BLOOD, SOLIDE, DEATH, LIFE, ESCAPE, SAFETY.  Everyone slowly started realizing that Rox had been killed in a remorseless and calculated attack.
The V-Plane was out of Comm distance due to the planet’s energy fields, and this murder seemed perfectly timed for this exact opening.  The rest of the crew was gone when Solide had made his move.
He Railine recalled the bodies stacked in the Reiko-10 CC, at least one of which had clearly turned on each other likely using this very axe he held.  And now right in front of him his friend Rox blown away in moment.  Why was this happening!?
“Rox!  Noooo!” Ryla screamed, falling to her knees.  The dogs all started barking wildly, they were smart enough to not approach Solide as they could sense his readiness to shoot.
In near perfect reaction Aria fell to the ground, swinging her rifle around and sighting it directly onto Solide’s chest.  His weapon was powerful, but so was hers.  It would explode apart his body and the slug would travel through the wall before ending in some snow dune a long distance outside.
“Solide!” Railine yelled, holding the axe in a firm grip in front of him, Laina had brandished her Nano-Blade and the three of them faced him.  Laina quickly moved forward to go Rox’s bleeding out body while keeping her eye on Solide.
“Not so fast there, bitch,” Solide warned as he pointed at her with the gun.  “You take one more step and you are going to be joining her.  I’ve really hated your fucking face from the beginning and I’ve been looking for a reason to rearrange it.”
“What are you doing!?” Laina shouted; she was the type to never swear, unlike Solide’s endless stream.
“What have you done?” Railine demanded.
“Solide, whyyyy!?” Ryla sobbed.  The dogs barked and growled loudly but did not get close.
“Are you going to let me talk?” Solide asked.  No one said anything because Laina was the most extroverted of the ones alive and she was likely too busy wondering if she should chance him shooting her.  “Shut those fucking dogs up before I shoot them!”
He had to think fast to save the dogs, now that their caretaker was dead.  “Hey,” Railine walked over, grabbing them and shaking them a bit.  “It’s okay, calm down.  It’s okay…Rhett, hey boy, calm down.”  It seemed like when he called the dog by its name it seemed to have calmed down.
Solide laughed.  “We are in a bad situation boys and girls, and little Ms. Doggy over there is a traitor in our midst.”
“Put your gun down, and we can talk.  How do you know?” Railine asked.  Railine could put a calm front on, even if his mind was trying everything it could to race away.
“I am quite happy holding this, especially with shy bitch over there sighting me up.  Just know if you put me down, I am Solarian and you will regret it when you get swarmed by these fucks later.”
Ryla was still crying, shocked over what had occurred so rapidly.
“ ‘Solarian’?  What!?  What was wrong with Rox?!” Railine asked.  “What are you doing!?”
“I am going to give it straight to you there, fire-boy.  We are fighting an enemy that you cannot possibly comprehend.  An enemy that makes you question what you know, and whom you trust.  You think that fucking creature I laid out earlier is anything!?  That’s our true enemies’ PAWNS.  This whole fucking planet is likely infested and over-ran.  Clearly I am not the only Solarian left here or you all would turn Death Angel on me and rape me out.  Yet with how bold the dog bitch was, it makes me think one or more of you are Death Angels already.”
Railine had no idea what he was talking about.  He also had no idea how to calm him down.  As a rescue-type he was good in chaotic situations where it was versus the elements; but if he was good with psychos he would have been in security or therapy.
“Can we talk about this, or are you just going to yell?” Railine asked trying to stay calm.
Solide started laughing.  “We were placed on this planet as a trap to see what happens, to see if we can win against these fucking things.  Obviously the answer is no, as Seven found out, and all the other bases apparently. You fuckers are so behind the curve here, I feel bad for how stupid you are.”
Railine had heard that insult before, many thought he was dumb because his face was scarred and ugly and he rarely talked, but they were wrong about that.  If Solide would only explain what he knew there was a very good chance Railine could grasp it quickly.  Solide’s words implied he knew way more than he let on and perhaps encountered this before.
“Solide, explain to us.  If we are going to survive we have to work together!” Railine pleaded.
“Let me save Rox,” Laina begged as she took one step closer.
“Rest assured there, lovely lady, that our dear friend Rox is quite dead.  If you kill the angels while they’re in this form it’s harder for them to come back.”
Laina looked menacingly at him, “Don’t you call me that.”
“What?  No ‘asshole’ or ‘fucker’?”  Solide grinned darkly in a scary smile as he showed all his teeth.  “Try it.  Sometime it becomes addicting.”  
“Evidently so does murder, you psycho.”  Laina turned her face away from looking at Rox who, unlike the alien body, had more than enough blood splattered and was bleeding out across the room.
“See if you like when I talk to you like this better: one step more and you’re gone bitch,” Solide said to the wary medic.

“How do you know she’s a traitor?  Traitor to what!?” Railine asked.
“To life.”
This guy was a psycho.  How could they stop him without losing anyone else?  If Railine could get behind him…one slash with the axe would end him.
“I liked you Solide, why are you like this?” Ryla asked between her tears.
“She found something at Seven.  Saw her pick up what looked like a weapon and pocketed it silently.  It didn’t sit well with me, and now that I am back here with everyone dead, it’s obvious where her loyalties lie.”  
“What the hell kind of logic is that!?” Railine yelled in a rare obscenity from him.
Solide looked angry.  “You don’t get it.  I’d seen this shit before.  Once we were at Seven it was clicking why the fuck I was here.  No one else should have known…but Rox did.  It was suspicious enough, but why would she think to do something like that?”
“You idiot!  What do you think I got this axe from?”  Railine hardly processed that, to a psycho like Solide maybe that was reason he should shoot Railine as well.
Closing his eyes he softly laughed to himself.  “So simple-minded.  You grabbed that axe for protection from the big bad monsters around you.”
“And what did she do!?”
“You had the axe is plain view, just like Madigan had some weapon also; you were not hiding it from us.  Further, I watched that whore’s face close when we got back, she showed no sign of surprise when we were the only ones left here.  She knew…the bitch.”  
Railine considered himself a student of logic, and such a perversion of thought process was tough to endure especially when lives were being sacrificed on the altar.  “Unbelievable.”
Laina frowned.  “I never liked you, and this completely proves how right I was.  Are you going to put your gun down?  You can’t take all of us.”
Solide started laughing.  “You are way wrong there, bitch.”  He turned to Ryla.  “I am only going to tell you once, Ryla, come with me if you want to live.”  She was sniffling hard, wiping her tears, confused about what he was asking.  “One of these other four is a Death Angel.  I’m sure there was at least one with the other group too, so I have no doubt they’re probably wiped out by now.”
What was he talking about?  Solide always seemed unfriendly, but now being completely crazy at a inopportune time like this was very, very bad.
“Don’t you dare go with him,” Laina said.
“He’s crazy, Ryla,” Railine agreed.  Aria stayed silent, having her preference of Ryla staying with them, but said nothing and kept her finger ready over the trigger.  She suspected Solide might be fast enough to shoot twice, but only at the two standing, he would certainly be dead after that.
Solide lowered his shotgun, closing his eyes.  “None of you guys have a clue what is going on here.  Ol’ Kalco’s the only other one that might have an idea.  Even if he knows, they are probably all dead already, or,” he paused for a moment, “sometimes they play fucked up games and pick you off one at a time to increase the fear.  Pure guess it’s that slutty pilot, Feyloose or whatever the fuck her dumb name is.  It’s always the type you don’t expect, and usually female.”
He started walking away before he continued.  “Watch shy sniper bitch, she was alone at Reiko-7.  Though, hell she could’ve been one even before that!”  He started laughing loudly.  “I could be surrounded by these things…maybe us Solarians are outnumbered already!”
“Why are you doing this!?”  Laina yelled at him.  “Answer us!”
He looked over his shoulder at her with an incredulous look.  “Fuck you.”  He turned and walked away.  No one made a motion at first until it was broken by Laina dashing to Rox.
Railine ran over to a storage locker in Alpha wing, grabbed a Medi-kit, and ran back to where Aria was now by Laina, the two of them working on the shot up body.  He ripped it open and the three of them rapidly worked together, though they had little practice as a team before this.  Out of the three, he was likely the least skilled, as capable as he was, and deferred to them.
Laina had her vibro-surgery scalpel out and had ripped off the clothes on Rox’s upper body while Railine slathered Undifferentiated Tissue on his hands and formed a crude bowl over the missing part of her cranial cavity.  The beads she wore in her hair hung in the bloody mess of her brain.  He could not help the thought that at some recent point she had selected these to wear…would she know they would have been floating in brain tissue later?
Laina was working fast, cutting vital organs at junctions to put new ones in, shouting commands Aria dutifully followed.  “Left ventricle, Spleen, intestine bypass, two medium stops…”  Aria formed the requested things out of a mix of rapid UDT and its composite nanite mix as she handed it over.  Laina slapped in the replacement organs amidst Rox’s body undergoing desperate nanite behavior trying to save what was likely a losing cause.
“She needs a Booster, she’ll N-Limit for sure!” Railine yelled to Aria.  Aria nodded, taking a syringe out of the bag and injecting it silently into Rox’s leg.  For Railine this was always the weirdest.  Here was her body, most certainly dead, yet just moments ago her toned legs were ready to run and jump and play.  Life was so weird to him.  How could she be so strong, so vital, and ready to live to a ripe old age, but cut down so easily?  Now, this body that had such potential was bleeding out and soul-less.
The Booster stopped any chance of an N-limit, but the downside was essentially re-writing her nanite programming for the short term.  If she N-Limited she was dead, but without fully functioning nanites her life truly lay in the three around her.
 Laina worked her way to the head, pouring a different type of programmed UDT into her skull that mainly was simply used to stop brain hemorrhage.  Brains could be reconstructed, but not easily and quickly in the field, so doing this merely stabilized her for the time being.  Then with Railine they held their hands in a rough shape as the material, along with Rox’s nanites understood the programming and slowly laced together a crude framework of a skull.
For now all they could do was wait.  Rox was not ‘alive’ in a conventional sense right now, that was clear.  At best, perhaps residual system nanites could continue system preservation.  With some remote chance maybe a part of Rox was still alive somewhere, and they could drag her from the brink.  Reiko-10 had a good medical lab, and with some time they could boot up some of the machines and put her in a cyro tank to heal her.
“I’ll get a Res Kit,” Railine declared as he stood up.  They were pretty expensive and rare, but it was advanced science to basically ‘reboot’ somebody back to life.  The kit threaded a very fine line between the certain death of an N-Limit where nanites literally consumed the whole body, and allowing nanites to operate at nearly full capacity to try to reconstruct ‘normal state’.  As to what happened to a person’s life energy or soul when reconstructed from machines in their body Railine did not know.
Laina reached out and grabbed his hand, shaking her head no.
“Why?  There’s a chance!  The kit will restart a normal functioning nanite cycle and we stopped the N-Limit, most of her body is in good shape.  I’ve seen worse come back.”
Laina said in a very cold manner, “No you haven’t.”
Railine denied it, “No one time, this guy…”
Laina stood up, almost tears in her eyes.  “No you fucking haven’t!”  The profanity hung in the room due to its rarity, unlike Solide’s every other word preference.  “She was dead and on the verge of N-Limiting, you don’t come back from both!”  She turned her head to the side, wiping tears away.  “Fuck…not again…”
Aria was still silently kneeling as Ryla stood up and ran over, grabbing onto Railine and hugging him, making it rather obvious how young she was amidst the older people around her.  He held his bloody hands away from her.  Her actions reminded Railine of a painful past of a sister he lost and held her tightly in return using just his elbows.  There was no way to get back what he lost; he had vainly tried that path for a while.  All he could do now was comfort this simple girl way over her head.  Railine also felt over his head and he had seen a lot more dead people in his life then this young girl softly whimpering into his body.
Aria stood up, lifting her left arm straight above her head, her right pointed at the ground.  She swung each in an opposite arc until they were pointing down and up respectively before pulling together in front of her chest, nodding at Rox’s body before respectfully stepping away.
Slowly the intensity of the room died down.
“You know the Star Priestess departed prayer?” Railine asked Aria.
“Yeah…I’ve seen them do it a few times.”
Railine did not pry into why Aria was with a Star Priestess at the time of someone’s death.
“What did he kill her for?” Railine rhetorically asked.
Aria answered, surprising everyone with her soft but firm voice.  “Solide, Rox and I were partners at Reiko-7.  We had split up and were checking different rooms, that’s where Solide said I was alone, but we all of us were.  I came back and saw her holding the artifact, she said it would ‘light our darkest hour’.  Solide must have seen her grab it, and interpreted it wrong.”
“Very wrong,” Railine said.  “He is unhinged.  His gun is very powerful too.”  Railine was quite competent with melee weapons, but without a force bracer or an energy shield he would get killed going against him.  “I have seen a lot of weapon injuries, and with our nanites we should be able to survive a fair amount of them, but that weapon has high-end written all over it.”
Laina showed an interest in the item Aria mentioned.  “Where did the artifact go?”
Aria slowly responded when she realized no one else could answer.  “Not sure.  She definitely had it with her when we came back.”
“She hid it somewhere on the base,” Laina said, though it was more of an accusation.
“Yeah…maybe he is looking for it now.”
“Do we go after him?” Laina asked.
“I don’t want to,” Railine replied.  “If he wants to stay hidden he will.  He didn’t seem intent on killing all of us, so if we stay together that’s probably the best.”
Ryla slowly broke away from Railine.  “Thanks, and sorry.  What do we do now?”
“Clean up first,” Railine walked over to a bathroom, rinsing his bloody hands.  The two other woman did the same.  As the warm water was running over his hands and cuffs of his jacket it was strange watching the blood of his friend wash off, so red at first, gradually going clear.  If the situation was more normal or more safe he would be much more reflective, as of right now he just had to survive.
Ryla continued with her questions, “What did he mean Kalco knew but they were likely all dead?  And why do we need to watch Aria?”
He did not answer her immediately.  Railine hated that in his mind, as crazy as Solide was, there was perhaps an element to his madness.  Solide would gun Rox down for whatever she had, and Aria was with her at the time of the crime.  It was possible Aria had the item.  Aria was evasive about where it went or what it was.  That made him remember the weapon Madigan found as well, but apparently because he kept it in the open all was okay.  There were a lot of unanswered questions.  In part of his mind, emotionally he could see how Aria was someone to watch, simply by virtue of accomplice of the dead target at his feet.
No…this is why everyone at Seven died.  Read too much into anything and everyone around him was an enemy…simply not true.  By the same logic Solide could be guilty and was killing off the only two who knew something he had done.
 “He’s crazy, don’t read too much into it,” Railine tried comforting her.  “Any of us could be suspects if we let our minds break down.”  The dogs started growling as they all turned and formed a line towards one of the doors outside.  “But…”   His voice trailed off as his eyes processed a figure in the room at the weapon locker.  The other’s slowly turned to look.  “Solide went down Delta…who the hell is that?”
As if the very act of being noticed alerted it, the being suddenly came dashing at them.  It backhanded Ryla hard who took to the air before crashing to the side.  The figure reared a huge blade from its right side, crashing it at Railine who by pure reflex moved part of the axe in the way to take a partial hit.  It knocked him down and the axe spun away to the side, leaving him defenseless to the next attack.  One of the dogs jumped in front of Railine, rearing down and growling loudly at the creature.
It stepped forward to attack him or the dog when Laina brought her Nano-Blade down across it, cutting its left shoulder completely off.  It backhanded her without a second thought as she rolled to the ground.  Moments later there was a large explosion of a weapon going off and with a splash of blue like a water balloon exploding backwards, the creature’s head was blown apart as it dropped to the ground.  The liquid was much like steam in that it evaporated away.
Railine quickly scrambled to his feet, grabbing the axe and running at the creature, hitting the weapon downwards over and over as he cleaved it into sections; to the survivors in the room no one knew if it mattered, or if it was dead from Aria’s shot.
He was breathing hard, a new blue color dripping down his axe.  As he watched the blue disappeared as it was absorbed, or if it never existed in the first place.  “Okay, what the hell is going on here?  How did we go from a base of eighty people, to now only ten of us and all we know for sure is the four of  and the psycho?”
“It’s just like Seven…it’s just like Seven…”  Ryla was still crumbled on the floor, repeating the line.  The dog ‘Ricochet’ walked over licking her in the face.  She stayed unmoving.
Laina got up and walked over to the girl along with Railine.  “Are you ok?”
She didn’t answer, and when Laina grabbed her hand and pulled her up, she responded with a grunt.  Once standing, she nodded.
“It looks like a girl also…” Aria said, staring down at the body.  Railine came over, and it was indeed unnerving now that he could look at it, as massacred as it was.  The face had a blank, sad stare in it.  The body was humanoid, minus a mutated arm that was the weapon that nearly killed one of them.  The eye was pupil-less, staring blankly at the world.  There were black lines down its face and on some parts of its body, almost looking like a Strive or perhaps some sort of body art.  Maybe some sort of religious fanatic?  Did that fit at all with what was going on here?
“Anyone on our base?” Railine asked.
“No…” Ryla said.
“Long hair, sorrowful face…  You know…it sort of looks like you Aria,” Laina said.
Railine looked, and when he did, he felt the tension of the room go up again.  He was trying very hard to not suspect Aria of…something.  Yet the figure looked like a remote clone of her perhaps, and was tangentially related to the events that just happened.
“What are you saying?” Aria asked.
“Simply about what Solide said, and what this thing is.”
“Aria is our friend, she killed this thing!” Ryla yelled.  “God, why is everyone like this!?”
Railine looked at the face a bit more.  The blank eye staring out, the facial tattoos etched on one side, almost like part of its face was falling off or changing into something…it made him wary.  This was one similar to the first one they killed in that it had the torn and tattooed face on one side whereas the other looked like a fairly normal woman.  Railine recalled the body they had seen in Seven with the complete facial markings on both sides, but was unsure the connection. He should have inspected that body closer at the time.
 Stepping back from the hacked up remains, he started to assert control, “If there is any doubt, we need to arm up.  Armor, shields, weapons, Medi-kits…”
“And what?  What do we do?” Ryla questioned, her voice panicked.
“Stay alive.  Hope the others come back.  Watch for Solide.”
“Do we shoot him?” Laina asked.
“I’m not sure.”  Railine looked down at the floor.  In a very short time his friend Rox was murdered, and a second humanoid creature attacked them, both of their bodies in piles on the ground.  He really wanted a flamethrower, but against the fate he felt like he was fighting, it did not seem close to sufficient.  “If I catch him unaware I will kill him,” he replied, his hand tightening around the axe.
“Well, that’s at least two of us,” Laina responded.  “What do we do with the dogs?”  Laina held her hand out and the dog started growling slightly; she pulled it back.  “They make me wary with their master dead.”
“Rex was ready to defend me, that’s enough in my book.”
“I like them,” Aria added.
“It’s settled then, we keep them around,” Railine said.  Laina didn’t like being out-voted but didn’t say anything.
This was like a rescue that was one disaster after another and the heroes are the ones needing saving. The central open room had become bunkered in a short period of time, and with three bodies strewn across the floor, it was starting to take on an appearance not unlike Seven.  Railine was looking at all the piled areas that people could hide behind, wondering if they needed more protection given how fast that thing had gotten through.  His eyes nor and then caught the three bodies of Rox and two vaguely similar creatures splattered across the floor.  Splattered…but only Rox was bleeding.
Bleeding…
“I got an idea.”  In Railine’s mind it made a lot of sense, if Solide had any glimpse of any truth.
“Tell me it’s how to end this nightmare,” Ryla pleaded.
“I could be way off, but Solide has been through something like this before.”
“Don’t go there,” Laina said, “that psycho has nothing good for us,”
Railine walked over to the body he had hacked up.  Killing something was a first for him.  He had hacked through many an inanimate object to save people within, but this was a reversal of what he ever did.  Yet…there was hardly any ‘blood’, excluding the blue that had rapidly evaporated away even from his axe.  “He mentioned ‘infected’ and thought that Feyria was one.  Then we look at these things…and they look like people…females specifically.  There is no blood out of this thing, so what if we do tests on our own, with known clean blood, and anything we can get from this body?  We could throw Rox’s in there too.”
Ryla gagged a bit.
“Sorry Ryla, I am trying to be proactive here.  I am not sure what may or may not happen, but viruses ‘infect’ healthy cells.  So…”
“Wow, you are talking pure psuedo-science, all based on whimsical comments of a killer.  You know far less than me medically, and you think this will work?  You are a fool,” Laina commented.  The comment hung in the air.
“I have nothing else.”
“It’s stupid,” she said defiantly.
Railine stood up, staring at the prideful woman.  In some ways there was always a tension because Railine had a wide base of skills but medically she was very far and away from him.  She made sure he knew that fact often.  “It is what I am deciding.”
Laina threw a hand through hair, scoffing.  “We got a hack doctor here now…”
“Let’s go to the medical lab.”
They slowly started walking away from the scene of many recent crimes.  Aria tugged lightly on Railine’s wrist; he knew the shy woman enough to know what it meant as Ryla, Laina, and the three dogs went ahead.
“Rox could have been res-ed,” Aria simply stated.  It was a dark confirmation of what he expected…of what he knew.
“Why?”
“She wasn’t departed yet.”  Aria paused before adding, “As the Star Priestesses say.”
Railine looked back at Rox’s body no one had covered or moved, shot and killed.  At this point it was too late.  N-limit had been boosted away and she had not recovered naturally nor res-ed and was conventionally dead now.
“You know more than me, why didn’t you say something?”
“Too hard.”
Railine may have chided her, but could he really?  He knew using the Res Kit or trying to get her in a cryo tank was worth a shot, yet backed down to Laina’s insistence of her death.  Aria was far more passive, even if she did know more medically; to think she would raise an issue against the forceful Laina was unrealistic.
Tearing his eyes away from the body that was once his friend he could only look down.  Did Rox’s death rest on Railine’s hands because he was too intimidated to say something?  He deferred to the superior Laina about preserving the expensive technology instead of ‘wasting’ it on a useless cause given the horror they were heading into.
But now, even if Solide was wrong about the other crew being betrayed within, it was unavoidable that there were only nine of them left and one of them was a murderer.

 
Zaier
Day-1, Midday
Location: V-Plane flying to magnetic disturbance

Zaier kept a secret from the people he was with.  Even if the secret was there implicitly, he knew that their chance for living was low.  It was quite clear they were out-gunned on something far beyond what they could understand.  It had wiped out Reiko-7, causing some sort of final-stand scenario with the base torched and all inside it dead.  Reiko-10 was a bit different in that everyone was gone, and at this point at least the base was still standing, but without being proactive it was over.
The reality was that 10 was likewise doomed.  He might be slated for a specific fate already, but the answer did not lay for him at 10.  He left the best ones he could to try to keep it going, while bringing the best he could for this expedition.  He did not have a specific plan, but seeking death with the possibility of escape was better than waiting for death with no chance of escape.
The plane bounced very subtly from the high winds, hardly moving him at all with his hand reflexively rubbing his chin as he looked at the window.  What a change from the recent flight where everyone was boisterous and loud; here even Feyria and Kalco sat silently.  
Heading out to the unknown, it was entirely likely this might be the same destination as what lured all the people from Reiko-10.  Maybe they would find frozen bodies along the way, or perhaps zombified bodies like the one that had attacked them, heh, anything was as likely as anything else.
There had been planet-wide surveys in the past and this area showed higher-than-normal on some measures but didn’t stand out until recently.  That is what attracted him; whatever occurred recently activated this site.
“Well, we are basically here,” Feyria announced.  The V-Plane was slowly banking, giving them a view of a generally unremarkable plateau.  “There are a few flat spots I can set down, want to get out?”
Zaier answered, “Picking up anything from here?  Any landmark…anything?”
“Getting some high grav and mag waves but…physically nothing.”
“Hey, cave or tunnel over there looks like.”  Kalco stood up, walking to the front and pointing over Feyria’s shoulder.
“No signs of life or movement,” Feyria reported.
“Land close, let’s look into it,” Zaier commanded. “There is a reason this location has increasing signatures.”  
Madigan contemplated for a moment before he spoke.  “Seems to me that it is an artificial signature;, planets don’t behave like that.  Definitely a beacon or something mechanical.  Why would something like that be out here?”
Zaier appreciated that he was intelligent.  “Exactly, and why now after the recent events?”
Madigan answered back, “Seems related, no way it is not.”
“Is this safe?  There are four of us, and if this wiped out both our bases, are we prepared for this?” Feyria asked.  “What about all the other people from our base?  What if they turned into that creature and attack us?”  She had a list of problems that were valid.
Kalco said, “You’re jumping to conclusions.  No way those idiots who walked off the base got here, and I don’t like standing around.  I don’t want to panic anyone, but we are in a bad spot, and unless we find some things out…”  He left it hanging.
The V-Plane’s grav plates shoved out all the snow as they landed on a flat rock on top of a sloping hill.  Close was the small tunnel and further than that was a sharp cliff on the other side.
Feyria pulled on the hood on the back of her coat as it stretched to cover most of her face and adjusted the piece over her mouth.  She pulled out some goggles she wore and put them on.  “Feel nervous…with everything happening and all.”
“Don’t.  I know you’re pretty damn fast, and the three of us all know a bit about combat,” Kalco said to her.
Feyria pulled a pistol out from under her seat and cocked it, letting out a satisfying ‘Tink!’ sound as it crashed forward.  “I am not worried about that, just…I don’t know if I want to say it.”
Madigan scoffed a little, shaking his head.
“What?  This isn’t like you to be avoid being direct,” Zaier said.
She was still sitting in the pilot seat as she turned to look forward onto the icy planes outside.  “No one is really talking about how bad this is, and that we know nothing about what is happening.”
“That is why we are out here, to be proactive compared to reactive,” Zaier explained.  She was smart enough, she should understand this.
“No…I just got a bad feeling about some of those others.  I am really glad I got stuck with you guys.”
“ ‘Stuck’,” Madigan imitated.
“Let’s go.”  Kalco broke the conversation, moving towards the door.
Feyria let out a long sigh, and then slowly pushed herself up.  “Hey, there is some extra stuff in the back.  If you guys need any weapons or anything, grab them before we leave,” Feyria said.
“Why are there weapons…” Zaier caught himself.  Feyria did something that he would not have approved of normally, but in this case, proved useful.  “Grab anything you may want.”
Kalco spun his pistol ‘Aelishun’ around a few times.  “Not me, I got everything I need right here.”
Feyria joked a little, “You will be the first one thanking me…”
“Sure.  But I still don’t need the Medi-kits or whatever you got back there,” Kalco said to Feyria  “You take everything you can get.”
“When you are bleeding out and you grab that Medi-kit you will owe me double since you think you didn’t need it.”
He had a glint in his eye, spinning his pistol.  “Naturally.  I love giving women twice what they think they can handle.”
Zaier was quite confident that pistol was either ultra-elite Solarian tech, or more likely some sort of alien tech given its power in it diminutive frame, but he trusted him as a soldier so he didn’t mind.  He knew that Kalco knew of that understanding even if it was never spoken.
“Any shotgun or energy weapons?” Madigan asked.
“If you are nice to me, I might have one hidden for you,” Feyria said.
Madigan looked away, rather preferring to go without than make any acquiescence.  
“Look through her little stash, then we are moving out,” Zaier told him.  He headed back and opened a few of the back cabinets until finding the right one.  She had grenades, ammo, a few weapons and a few Medi-kits hidden in the back of the plane.  Normally it would have been grounds for pretty significant disciplinary action, but in this case was only grateful.  He grabbed a couple grenades, an ammo block, and a Medi-Kit into his backpack.
Walking back to his seat, he grabbed the Pulse Rifle, slinging it over his back.  Then he pulled the part of the jacket up around his nose and mouth before pulling on the back as the hood extended to cover the top of his head and face, opened a side door, and stepped outside into the cold air.
From here was a good vantage point of the planet Reiko as any.  They were on top of a long hill on this side, giving them a good view of the white planet.  The endless sharp hills of white and gray spread away from them in all directions.  Further in the distance a taller peak had a long trail of white blowing off of it into the sky from the strong wind.  It just had the look of ‘cold’ to it, and where he was wasn’t even warm.  It would have been a good sight, beautiful even, if it was a vacation viewed from the safety of a space-borne vehicle.  They could take a few memories and store them away in some technology, ‘ooh’ and ‘aww’ and then retreat back to warm beds, drugs, and holographic masturbation fantasies.  
To Zaier, they were tactical considerations that were all negative.  The raw distance back to their base would be impossible to traverse through the snow and steep hills.  Well, to modify that statement, it would be possible, but the cold even through their suits would leave them dead more than likely before they got there. 
They had landed on a high, narrow ridge.  There were two step cliffs on both sides.  Kalco was next out and walked up past the tunnel to where the other side of the cliff was, looking at the views perhaps.  Feyria came up to Zaier, and despite the amount of times they had sex, it was a thing very far from his mind.  “Glad you brought me.”
“I needed a pilot.”
“Is that all?”
Zaier hated these types of games.  The possibilities of his response did little to excite him as they were all so droll:
‘Oh no, I really like you!’  Useless given they were already intimate.
‘I needed someone cute to cheer me up’  Flirty, but not his style.
‘Yes’  Cold; he liked that one the best.
Instead he asked something else useful, “Who are you wary of over there with your earlier comment?”
“Heehee, nearly all of them, honestly.  Ryla’s a nice girl, but the rest of them…  You got that psycho Soley, you got that dumb ape Rile with the scarred face.”  Feyria had a way with names, a bad way, but to Zaier it was occasionally humorous.  The general disdain for getting something so basic correct about others had an endearing quality to it he liked.  “You got that woman with a worse mouth than most of the guys…”
Madigan came up, holding a screen in his gloved hand.  “We are defiantly close to this source.  I really hope this tunnel gets us close.  The presence of this feels totally artificial given the general geology around the area.  The weathering patterns don’t suggest there should be tunnels or caves based on the general metamorphic structure the planet seems to be.”
“You some sort of scientist?” Feyria taunted him.
“I know way more than you…”   ‘Stupid cunt’ was whispered but Zaier heard it.
“See anything?”  Zaier asked Kalco who was higher up the hill, overlooking the other side.
“No,” and he came walking back to the group.
Zaier walked forward into the icy tunnel as they all dutifully followed.  They came to a place where the snow had long since built up, it was a huge wind drift inside the tunnel. Damn it, all this way for a snow mound.
“I could try melting it,” Madigan suggested.  “I’ve seen these kinds of things in caves before.  It is just where the wind dies and all the snow falls out.  No way we could easily dig through that, but it shouldn’t actually be that far to melt.  Mind if I take a shot?”  He was holding some sort of energy weapon in his hands.
“Do it.”
He came up, and with a quick trigger pull a ‘Psheeewww’ sound emitted as a bright blast of green light flew out.  They were hit with a wall of steam and only through the after-image did they realize the shot blew through the snow pile and discharged against some far wall.  He pulled the trigger twice more, widening the path, and slung the weapon over his shoulder.  “I was on a mining colony for a very short bit.  They would do something like this to ‘dig’ rather than excavate as it would save time not having to deal with material.  It was not effective for getting all the small stuff out, but very fast for getting to deeper ores.”
“Aren’t you so smart?” Feyria said dismissively.
“Prove you are capable of doing anything beyond fucking and flying.”
“What did you say!?”  Zaier smiled, he liked when Feyria got upset like that.
“Press on,” Zaier said.
Madigan was right on some level, this did not feel like a tunnel the further they went in.  With the bouncing of their lights, the snow drifts and the darkness hid a lot but not for long.  Far enough in, it was clear now that this was metal, more akin to a hallway.  
“Definitely artificial.  The outside was hard to tell because it was weathering so bad.  All the snow, rocks, and ice piling up made it look similar to a real cave, but…”  Madigan held his energy rifle that had a green glowing light on it and knocked it against the wall where it clanged.  “Metallic.”
Zaier stopped where the tunnel narrowed slightly… into a rectangular portal.  “A door, or hatch.”
“For sure.”  Feyria came up, rubbing her hand over it.
“Any idea how old this is?” Zaier asked.
“Well, tough to tell what we are even in, but given the action outside…” Madigan’s voice faded a bit.  “It’d just be a guess really.  Definitely pre-Space age for us at least.”
“Idiot,” Feyria muttered.
“Think about this though,” Kalco began.  “Old for sure, but this door is Solarian sized.”
“Aelisha?” Feyria offered.
Kalco walked over, lowering his head very slightly before tapping on the top.  “Don’t think so.  Aelisha are slightly taller, but their ears add a lot.  Trust me, they don’t like hitting them; the doors would be bigger.”
Placing his hand on the top of the door he walked into the next room as the rest followed.  Here there were what looked like it could be consoles of some kind.  There was a mist that hung down on the ground, and only the small pylons of these consoles pushing up through the mist were any break to the otherwise quiet and square room.
“Isn’t it odd there is mist here?”  Kalco asked.
“No, it’s warmer,” Madigan was saying.  “Look, no steam from our breaths either.”  He pulled his face mask off and breathed out hard to show his point.”
“Well, I don’t like the reason that might be,” Kalco responded.
“Me either.”
Zaier walked up to one of the consoles, the mist was swirling past his legs from his motion.  Zaier hit a button and…nothing happened.  “No power.”
“Maybe.  What if you needed to hit the right button?” Madigan suggested.
Zaier hit a few more but nothing seemed to happen.
Feyria came up to the next one, hitting random buttons.  “It’s easy to think it’s just dead.  But I imagine the V-Plane: it’s not actually that complicated to start, but unless you knew the right combination it’d seem just as dead.”
Zaier whimsically stated, “ ‘A million monkeys on a million typewriters…’” as he taped away.
“What?” Feyria asked him.
“Nothing.”  He didn’t expect anyone that smart to understand his reference here truthfully.  He poked decisively at a combination of a few buttons, holding his finger a moment before hitting the final button to a grand fanfare of pure silence.  Given enough time and attempts if something could occur, it would.  But in this case, not now.
He looked up and away from the useless thing.  “That way.”
Inside the next room there was a soft light from something in the corner; no one wanted to get too close to it.  It looked generally innocent though given that it looked a lot like a lantern: a square box holding a glowing thing and a handle.  The mist here on the ground was slowly flowing towards the far door; illuminated by this light it looked like a stream flowing through the door.  As Zaier walked in, the disturbance was enough that it would kick up the mist and blow out of the way near him.
“That’s pretty cool,” Feyria said. “The light and the mist are pretty.”
“It’s probably some emergency light someone left maybe,” Kalco said.  “Hope they aren’t around.”
“Someone?” Madigan asked.  “Doubt it, probably long since dead.  That thing is pretty simple; a mild radioactive like that can glow for a long time.  Still if that’s true, it suggests someone was still alive this thing stopped working that they needed the emergency light.”
“Hey, is it me, or is it getting brighter in here?” Feyria asked.  
“No, it is getting brighter, but it shouldn’t be from that thing…” Madigan said.
“Oh fuck…shit shit shit!” Kalco yelled, realizing what it was.
Zaier was in the front of the group when the light grew brighter near the next door over.  The source of light was definitely coming down the hall.  His heart rate sky rocketed with the feeling as if he was a little boy beyond a doubt caught doing something bad.  It was as if the crypt keeper was completing his rounds, the light coming ever closer.  
Before he had much time to think, a strange creature slowly phased through the wall.  Humanoid and hovering above the ground as it entered, it was not unlike an angel or demon.  It was even complete with two large wing-like appendages adorned with an array of sharp angular objects similar to overlapping glass panes that were pointing downwards.
For the briefest of moments Zaier had a casual realization of noting the similar appearance between this thing and the creature they had seen on the base; this one seemed to be at a much more advanced level or stage.  
He did not have time to think for long, or to study its disturbing angelic face and its softly flowing energy-hair or the desperate look in its eyes, because fire suddenly came from behind him.  
Kalco’s pistol rang loudly, and it snapped Zaier to attention as he expertly rotated his rifle from behind his back, dropping into a kneeling position as he let it rain on this alien creature.  The previous startling fact of being able to go through a wall did not matter right now because there were only three ways out now: they kill it, it kills them, or they run; Kalco was trying the first.
The creature slashed its Solarian-like hand, and an invisible wave crushed the nearest consoles to tight blocks of metal.  On its back swing a spray of shards appeared in the air and sprayed towards them.
In Zaier’s past, he had been wounded in battle before and was surprised when sometimes it did not ‘hurt’, either from shock, the weapons, or nanite drugs.  Weapons were so damaging they didn’t cause pain; they would dismember or maim but there was little pain at the time of impact because the nerves were long gone.
This was not one of those times.
Across his shin and leg he felt as if cork screws had been stabbed into his bones and turned, followed by the feeling of them ripping out whatever bone fragments had been attached to the inclined plane.  A large object hit him in the shoulder and the pain was so unbelievable and not damped by nanites at all that it dropped him solidly to the ground.
“Holy fuck, shoot!” Kalco yelled.  Another ballistic sound joined and bright lights of green shot out from behind Zaier.
‘PAIN PAIN PAIN!’  His mind screamed as it felt like the nerves in his shoulder had been grabbed by something outside his body and were now being forcefully pulled out, dragging its way through every fiber of his body.
‘CALM DOWN CALM DOWN!’  He tried repeating to his mind.  “Kack!”  He coughed, spitting out blood.  “No!” he yelled mostly to himself, taking his other arm and gripping his shot shoulder, gritting his teeth and calling every mental focus exercise he could to bear.  He ineffectually lifted his rifle, spraying a few wide shots.  He used his foot to guide the rifle better and shot a few more bursts.
Behind him the relentless fire continued until he heard a shout of “Grenade!” and Kalco’s pistol stopped.  A moment later the two others did as well as a black object sailed past Zaier’s face.  Right after, he felt strong arms grab him and collectively tackle him to the side behind some objects.  Nearly right after, as he was still trying to decipher what was occurring beyond the delusional veil of pain, a large fire explosion shot through the room.
Something wasn’t right.  The pulling out of his nerves hit some sort of wall.  On this ethereal level it pulled and pulled and then…stopped.  It liked what it saw.
“Zaier!”  He was being shaken and he painfully opened his eyes.  It was Feyria that had risked herself to save him from the large explosion of the grenade.  “Zaier!”
“I’m…here…”  The fibers of his being had nearly been ripped out of this dimension, but now they were rooted back, slowly sending their tendrils out.  “Need to rest…my eyes….”  His head was impossibly heavy and fell forward into the darkness
 
Ryla
Day-1, Afternoon
Location: Reiko-10, Medical Lab

Ryla was under-gunned here in a lot of senses of the word.  Around her, the two of the other three argued as they moved equipment around, with Laina yelling about how stupid Railine was, and him standing strong.  Everyone was older here, stronger and more intelligent.  Railine had a battle axe strapped to his body, Laina had a sword of some type, and Aria had her huge rifle.  Everyone had some light armor on; Ryla was reluctant to put it on but Railine insisted.
A majority of the rest of the day we used moving supplies around the base, and Laina arguing with Railine over nearly everything.  Ryla shrugged her shoulders, a bit sore from the armor hanging over her jacket as she thought back to the recent arming up.  He had handed her a knife, and she shook her head no quite definitively:
 “Better safe than sorry.”
“Railine…I can’t…”
“Keep it.  You don’t have to use it if you don’t want.”  Ryla had reluctantly taken it, but did not plan on ever using any weapon again.
“You’re an idiot,” Laina said to Railine.  “Tell me your qualifications that at all come close to thinking this has any basis in biology.”
Railine set a heavy box down on a counter.  “There is a lot we need to try to get together, so are you going to help me or berate my intelligence?”
“You are a firefighter.  Everyone knows you don’t need to be smart to do that.”
Railine turned his eyes down for a moment, impressing Ryla with his control and poise.
“The blood paks are over in this right?”  Railed indicted a set of lockers.
“Yeah, but they are usually locked,” Laina responded.
“Well we need them.”  Railine lifted his axe, positioning it to pry the door open.
Laina came over, shaking her head.  “ ‘Try before you pry’ isn’t that the saying you idiots always use?”  She lifted the handle and door easily swung open.
“You said they were locked,” he shot at her.
“Usually.  Idiot.”
Ryla saw Railine bite his lower lip.  “I was confused for a long time why you and Kalco were together, but your behavior demonstrates that quite thoroughly…Aria grab some vials and bring them up here,”
Laina slammed her fist on the table.  “And what does that mean!?”
“You know nearly nothing about me, yet automatically assume you are superior to me.”
Ryla stayed quiet.  She was conflict-adverse to begin with and with all this talk of medical knowledge she was way over her head.  She knew some basics but all three of them knew way more than her.
“Ohhh?”  Laina hung onto the tone for a while.  “We are going there.  Do you have any inclination of how much training I have had, how much experience?”
Aria silently and dutifully came up to Railine holding a box of presumably vials.  Everyone here was not a talker at all beyond Laina and it was obvious in the domination of the conversation and the fact Railine was her target.
“You are assuming things.”  He moved some boxes to where she was sitting on the counter.  “More please.”  She sat there unmoving.  He turned and put it at a different spot.
Ryla had spent little time in this room.  She was not ever unhealthy, and wasn’t science-inclined thus had no reason to be here.  The room looked foreign and cold with strange metal arms reaching into the sky.  Lens, pipes, chemicals, tables…it was a sterile version of a mad scientist’s dream.  She felt something nudging her leg and she looked down, seeing Rhett whining softly.  She petted his head as he pulled his big brown ears back.  
“The fact I am even talking to you about this is unbelievable.  Compared to me you know next to nothing medically.”
Ryla expected an ‘I know that!’ with a fist slam.  But without even a sigh, Railine simply stated, “I never stated the contrary.  You are assuming that because I know less than you in a subject, I cannot come up with a novel idea, which is fallacious and betrays a deep seated ignorance.”
“Hahaha!”  She leaned back, a slightly spiky part of her hair pressing against an upper cabinet of medicine or chemicals.  “I am so tired of the utter trash that spills out of your idiotic mouth.”
Ryla knew these two had a deep antipathy towards each other, but was impressed that neither of them ever swore despite their anger at the other.  Maybe she had spent too much time with Solide and was used to a different standard.
Ryla calmly, if thoughtlessly, pet the dog that helped keep her calm and her mind off the fact that there was only five of them left on this base and the vague threat of Solide that the others were already dead.
She felt a subtle change in the dog’s ears.  She looked down and saw he was pulling his ears back as he started growling.
“Bark!  BARK!”  Rhett launched forward a bit, barking loudly at figure ambling into the lab.  Ambling, until it sensed them and proceeded to use inhuman speed to close the distance.
“Rai…!”  Ryla hardly had time to let out a peep before she dove to the floor dodging the creature.  The slash hit one of the metal science things and went sparking away as whatever electrical wire it was connected to was disconnected.  It swung again, hitting a large batch of tubes filled with fluids and blood, causing the attack to look ‘bloody’ as if it had spilled someone completely open.
She tried getting up only to look at the eerily human face and lost track of what she was doing.  
“Ryla, move!” Laina yelled.  Hearing it snapped her out of it and she scrambled backwards as fast as she could which was not very fast.  Rhett was barking and lunging at the creature.  Both of them seemed confused as to the other, wary of engaging.
Unceremoniously, a large axe swung horizontally and cleaved the creature into two.  Ryla felt a sense of relief that she had been saved, but the feeling listened only momentarily.  She was surprised that even being cut in half the creature still locked eyes with her.  It looked like it was going to crawl at her when the axe came down vertically and split its feminine head into a short lived blue mess of blood or steam.  Shortly afterwards the this blue mess completely faded away.
Railine jumped over the creature, putting a hand out to Ryla.  “You okay?”  She was touched that anyone cared about her honestly.  He hauled her up.  “Get ready, we aren’t alone.”
Railine turned his back to her, readying his axe again as there were two others already at the door.  In the mere moments it took to process, one of them had its head whipping backwards from a round exiting at unfriendly velocities.  The second paid no attention to its fallen comrade as it slashed wildly; completely destroying a table in a way Ryla thought was impossible for the creature’s smaller frame.  The exploding table caught Laina in a shower of shrapnel, causing her to raise her hands in defense as the creature moved in.
Ryla saw her react swiftly to bring her sword into interception with the creature.  What happened next made sense but perhaps was unexpected, as the high speed swing from the creature’s arm caught the Nano-Blade edge and completely cut its appendage off.  It apparently did not feel pain as it attacked again with its shorter stub at a faster rate.
Laina stepped backwards, still off guard and doing what she could to not be hit.  Railine had at this time closed the distance and swung, catching it in a glancing blow that did not finish it but drew its attention to him.  In the gap Laina stabbed forward at its face and drug the blade downwards.  With the combined injuries, there must have been enough damage done to do it in.  
The other dog’s had been drawn by the commotion and were all looking at the bodies; Railine grabbed one of them that was too close and pushed it away.  “No,” he said firmly.  It did not go back.
“Well, your stupid idea sure makes a lot of sense now,” Laina antagonized as she pointed to the clear waste of resources crashed on the floor.  “Get everything out of storage then let it get annihilated by these things.”
“I did not know that would happen!”
The people around her were strong and learning to adapt to this new situation, yet at this moment Ryla felt a hopelessness she never had before.  These things’ numbers were increasing, and Ryla was utterly dependent on the others for her survival.  She was realistic in that even if she wanted to, which she did not, she had zero skill with weapons and now was not the time she could learn.
In a calmer tone Railine continued, “I wonder if these things can sense our intention?  Are they trying to stop us from doing this experiment?”
Aria had disappeared at some point and popped back into the room.  “Come look at this.”
Ryla did not like the words out of the reticent woman’s mouth.
The three of them followed over to the ground vehicle bay.
“What happened?” Railine asked.  The large door was bashed inwards and snow was spilling in from the outside.  The door was made of heavy metal but crushed in with nothing in terms of any sign of resistance.
“Idiot.  It’s pretty obvious the room was destroyed.”
“But how…  Solide?”  Ryla asked.
Laina was nice to her in contrast.  “No, doubt it.  No bullet holes anywhere.”
Ryla shivered, feeling cold from the frigid air coming in.  It was not hard to see a portion of the wall caved outside.  “Not sure if you guy’s noticed, but did you see how easily that thing blew apart that table before it hit Laina?”  She paused; did she want to say the next part?  “Do you think it was that thing?  Is it capable of breaking metal walls down like this?”
“Unless we got a secret saboteur I’d say it’s a safe guess it was that thing, or any of them.”
“You guys are getting better at fighting those things,” Ryla said trying to encourage them but it felt hollow.
“Merely learning patterns of a dumb beast,” Laina said.  “We can last perhaps, but not forever.”
“Leaking heat,” Aria said, but only Ryla heard her.
“What?” Ryla asked.
“We are leaking heat.”
Railine looked at the source.  “Yeah, this is something new we may have to worry about if they just randomly attack a room like this.”
“Was it random?” she asked.
“You know, maybe not.”  Railine then told them, “The fusion reactor had been having some trouble lately and was due for some maintenance.  We have enough power for a while but the planet is just simply far too cold to have gaping holes bleeding out our heat like this.”
The body metaphor perhaps was unintentional given their backgrounds but Ryla understood why it was used and what it meant.  The planet was nearly inhospitable; even with their advanced suits they would die outside in a very short time.  Their warm base was a bubble that now had a deep gash in it.
“What do we do?” Ryla asked helplessly.  Outside the wind and snow was blowing in from the huge gap in the wall.  There was little light left in the day and it made her feel alone and afraid about what was on the ‘other side’ of that wall.  She swallowed slowly, trying to remain calm and convincer herself there was not a huge army of these things right on the other side of that door.  Right across from that door she could so easily open…
Railine pulled her out of the dark thoughts, “Welcome to our new normal.  I say we prop some stuff against this.  I can find a nano block and make some crude repairs but now more than ever I want to do this blood test.”
“You are still going on about that?  Our base is getting torn apart, we are under increasing attack, and you want to look at blood?”
“I do.  If we are reactive we die, we need to be proactive here, like Zaier said.”
“Great,” she said sarcastically.  “I’ll go prepare some slides for you right now.  ‘Doctor’.”
“Keep talking,” Railine stared at her, “it confirms my convictions even further.”
“What convictions?” Ryla asked.
Railine looked at her now.  “There are things happening here we cannot understand, Ryla.  I think you know that.”  Ryla prepared herself to simply be dismissed like she had her whole life, but was surprised he continued, “Look at the people left.  Solide claims that the other group had a traitor or was already dead or whatever he said.”  Railine paused, closing his eyes and rubbing them.  “Damn…what was that, only a cycle ago…that long…that short?”  He shook his head.  “Who was in that group?  Zaier since it was his idea, that pilot Feyro, Kalco, and Madigan.”  Ryla did not correct him on Feyria’s name.  “Who is the ONLY possible traitor there?”
“This is rich,” sarcasm dripped from Laina’s words, “Mr. Scarface is a logic master now…”
Ryla closed her eyes, thinking of the cool/calm Zaier, his ever ready face.  What was he looking for in his question?  She knew Zaier, so was that enough to remove him from suspicion?  Kalco was fun and flirty, he seemed pretty badass to her, as he had this ready and carefree attitude like his lazily spiked hair.  Madigan, well she knew nothing about him other than that he was scared of girls and probably gay.  Lastly was Feyria, and she seemed cool too.  So, was it Madigan?
“Madigan?”  It was half statement, half question.
“If anything went wrong, I’d think it’s him, too,” Laina said.
“No, it’s Kalco.”  His words hung in the air.
“What!?”  Laina turned to face the larger man.
He started to explain, “Assuming something started at the revelation at Reiko-7, Kalco is the only one it could be.  Zaier was with you Ryla, so unless you are also part of Solide’s inner circle, you by proxy clear him.  Feyria was piloting and Madigan was with me.  So you have to take my word he is good.”
“I don’t.  Your logic fails, because Kalco was with me.  So it is your word versus mine.  You cover for Madigan and I cover for Kalco; and this is all based on that murderer who we have to assume is somewhere still in this base.  Why are you even sowing all this panic?  It only hurts all of us.”
Railine nodded to himself.  “Of course.  I’d thought you’d say that, Laina.  All predictable really.  We will see.”
“We are in the middle of a crisis here and you want to distract us and use valuable medical items on something that is baseless.  You have me, way smarter than you, telling you—” she stopped herself, turning to Ryla and Aria.  “You guys have to see how suspicious he is, don’t you?  Do you know how many times or how bad of injuries I could have saved you from with that blood and UDT fluids that are now sprayed across the lab?  Aria, say something, you know this is a waste.  He knows nothing compared to either of us and is forcing us to use valuable resources.  Ryla, you have to see this.  He left the blood in the easiest place to be hit!”
Railine looked at her coldly.  “You are blaming me for an accident?”
“Was it?” she asked.  “We lost a lot of resources and you want to send more down a wasteful path.”
The two of them continued arguing while Ryla felt like on the verge of tears.
Aria walked up to Ryla, tapping her on the shoulder.  It was a very girly and socially awkward thing to do.  “Are you ok?”
Ryla put her head down, tears coming to her eyes.  “I…don’t know who to trust.”

 
Feyria
Day-1, Afternoon
Location: Ancient Ship

Feyria tried to hand an automatic-restitcher to Zaier, but he waved her off.  “I don’t want help.”
“But your shoulder…” she pleaded to him,
He had his own Medi-kit out, poking through it with at least a basic understanding but not medically skilled to any advanced degree.
“What the fuck was that?” Madigan asked, looking nervously down both hallways; Kalco was posted on the side it had first come from.  The other two men were talking about what just occurred, but Feyria was focused on Zaier.
“God damn…”  Zaier grimaced as he stabbed a needle into his shoulder.  “Fucking thing won’t stop bleeding.”  Grasping a few of these small pink things that were stabbed in his shins, he threw them to the side somewhat angrily.  He closed his eyes, taking a deep breath before opening his eyes again.  “Those words weren’t becoming of me, my apologies.”
Feyria was frowning.  She was close and intimate with him and this stubbornness was familiar if not wanted.  He had a fundamental deep trust at the core of his personality.  He did not swear often, so this showed a crack at the edge of his immaculate self-control.  
“Please, let me help you.”  She rubbed his good shoulder; he stared at her and looked away.
He said nothing and was trying to use a patch to hold his shoulder together.  It seemed like it held, but then it slipped off with a soft plop and a small spurt of blood.  His gritted his teeth and did not let out a cry of pain.
“Fine.”  Together they pulled out the various wedges that were lodged into his shins before it became obvious it hurt him too much to continue.  She moved up to his shoulder where the bigger injury was.  Helping him zip his jacket down, she helped pulled it away and cringed at what she saw.
It was bloody and his jacket was already soaked.  His tissue looked like it had a degree of necrosis to it as it looked pale and dead around the big cut of flesh that would not stay together.  It looked like a slab of meat that had been cleanly cut apart and was somehow rapidly rotting.
Needing a better look she took off the clothing on her face, taking off her goggles and brought her hood down, shaking her long soft hair out from behind her coat.  The winter gloves she had on were thin enough she could still use them for generally fine motor skills and left those on.  She knew some basics of advanced medical techniques, but was reminded she did not know enough for something like this.  
“Very strange, it’s a moderate injury but our nanites should be able to hold that together.  This thing…”  She stuck her fingers in his split shoulder and pulled out a small pink triangle that looked like a piece of glass the size of a finger.  It was blood covered but likely from that creature.  “It’s doing something to your body.”
Gently placing the two halves of his shoulder together, as she let go they would spilt apart with no indication of wanting to bind.  Around his shoulder was a purple and black spider web of lines crisscrossing leading away from the impact.  While she noted this, she did not say anything even to Zaier.  Perhaps some sort of infection or allergic reaction.  She hoped that pulling that remnant out would cause it to go away.  
Grabbing his shoulder she held the spilt muscle together and with her left hand rubbed the auto-stitcher back and forth working her way down as she had practiced once in a medical class a long time ago.  It whirred as it laid micro fibers down into his skin and literally weaved the skin back together.  She held it as she finished rubbing down the entire length of the wound, slowly letting go.  As it held, she was content she still remembered what to do, and was able to help him.
Her complete confidence did not last for long, as she saw his skin start to wrinkle together, and saw small rips in his flesh at some seams as if his skin was falling apart.  She gritted her teeth a little; that was definitely not normal, but at this point at least it held.  Really, they needed to talk to Laina, or that little sniper girl or fire fighter guy both knew some medical things – this group was much weaker medically.
“It’s holding for now,” she said, looking away.  She hated being like this, as she was not one for secrets.  She took a band of Undifferentiated Tissue and wrapped it a couple of times around his clavicle area not unlike a bandage before standing up away from him.  The UDT was merging in, but it seemed slower and not as readily as she remembered it being.
“I’d seen those things once before.”  Kalco’s word made everyone else silent with the implication.
No one said anything, hoping he would offer it himself.  Zaier let a long painful sigh out as he pulled his jacket back over his wound.
“Is it safe here to be talking?  Is that thing even fucking dead?” Madigan asked.
Kalco shrugged as if the question was as simple and meaningless as extra salt on some chips.  “Can’t say for sure, I didn’t see it die, so it’s likely still alive.”
“What the fuck are we doing here then!?” Madigan asked.
“Not saying it’s not dead, just didn’t see it die.  Grenade going off and all that.”
“It didn’t seem like our weapons were working, but the grenade seemed effective,” Madigan stated, partially asking.
“From what I can tell, they take damage, but more like a partial damage.  For whatever reason, though, flame and certain types of energy are fully effective on them, whereas other energy doesn’t work well.”
“Why would that be?”
He lifted his pistol, palm up in a shrug.  “I’m a soldier not a scientist.  Rounds pass through them or something, maybe flames don’t.  They can go through physical objects so maybe it’s the same with objects through them.  Look, I don’t fucking know.”
“When did you see them before?” Feyria asked.
Kalco looked down, swirling his gun in a circle stirring up some of the mist that had worked its way back into the room.  “It came to be known as the ‘Elyria Modality’ in some mission brief somewhere.  I lived through the shit, I don’t know how or why it happened.”
“It’s fine, tell us what you can,” Zaier said.
“These things are capable of appearing out of nowhere, but not exactly anywhere.  It’s like some sort of rule we can’t understand but it is often correlated to population centers, but again not always like we see here.  We ran into two different types of them, the one we saw when we first came back, and these ‘Death Angel’ forms of them.”
“ ‘Death Angel’?” Feyria asked.
“Yeah, from what we can tell, this is what their real essences is.  It’s like an advanced version or something of that thing we killed at Ten.”
Madigan waved his gun.  “Some sort of energy demon!?  Do you at least see them coming!?”
Kalco stopped swirling his gun, still looking down, his hand tightening around his pistol.  “Rarely.”
The word hung heavy.
“Fuck,” Madigan said.
Kalco’s words were slow as he reminisced, “Back then, we ran into two of them, I think.”
“You think?” Madigan said.
That question made Kalco snap.  “Yes, that’s what I fucking think!  Do you think you can recognize that specific fucking one next time you see it!?  The worst part was, we thought we were just fighting one, but there was one in our midst the whole time!”
Madigan took a calmer tone as he processed what Kalco just said. “What do you mean?”
“Not sure if they all can, but what we saw right now was its ‘True’ state, I believe.  But they can take others, this one looked like a person.”  Kalco paused for a moment.  A weird thought he couldn’t place passed through his mind about the word ‘true’ but let it go as he couldn’t pin it down.
“Like one of us?” Feyria asked worriedly.  Kalco nodded grimly.
“Holy fuck…how do we know?”  Madigan asked.
Kalco’s cockiness made a small return.  “You don’t.  Not easily anyway.  On the surface they can look, talk and feel like us.”  He walked over, kicking the mist away until he found something, lifting up a large glass plate that was left from that creature’s attack.  “They can manifest as solid as appropriate, but their primary state in energy based.”  He poked his chest a few times, “We are matter based, you shoot me, I might die, but my body is still here, it’s still something, but these things…” he threw the pane to the ground, and as hit, it shattered into thousands of pieces before dissolving in a sparkly steam that rose upwards then disappeared.
He didn’t say anything for a while.  “It is like they don’t even exist, except for all the torn apart bodies around you.  They are some sort of energy or dimensional thing.  I have no idea what the fuck it is, but they are damn scary, and damn powerful.  There is so much crazy shit out there, I only know a little of it and it would blow your mind.  Regardless, things like appearance are very easy to modify, suffice to say.”  He pointed to his own face.  “A pretty face can hide an evil mind, as we unfortunately found out.”
“We can’t wait for it to come back, we need to keep moving,” Zaier said, standing up.  He swayed for a second, grabbing a nearby console for support.  “I don’t know how long I will still be mobile.”
“Wait, so what happened?” Madigan asked the soldier.
“We got wiped out.  There were four Classed teams that ultimately were sent in.”
“So twenty people total,” Zaier said
“Heh, impressed you knew that current squad size is five, I’m guessing you were a Classed at some point too?  I had a feeling,” Kalco said back; it was a conversation the other two did not understand.  “I was on the first team in while another came in from another side.  It was a dual operation which is rare.  Two others got called in for backup trying to save this Star Priestess or some shit, I forgot what she supposedly was.  We got killed off one at a time and for a long time it was just me and this Assault Class named Braid left alive.  That fucker was brave and tough, but…” Kalco took in a deep breath.  “You can say I am the ‘sole survivor’ for now, I guess.”
Madigan was confused, “Why ‘you guess’?”
“You ever hear of ‘Marking’?  All rumors of course, but I know I don’t fucking doubt it anymore.  Somehow these things pick up your life frequency and eventually track you down.”
“And then?” Madigan’s voice was rushed.
“Well then you aren’t the sole survivor anymore.  Naturally.”  Kalco laughed at his own dark joke.
Feyria started crying from what was going on.  
“That didn’t happen,” Zaier said definitively.  “Feyria, don’t listen to him.”
“How the fuck would you know?”  Kalco turned defiantly towards the man who was leaning against the console.
Despite Zaire’s face being clean, it would have fit the feeling of the room better, if he was bloody and he was grinning through the pain.  “I’d know.  That did not happen.  You made that entire thing up.  You didn’t even know who you were rescuing?”
Kalco laughed; it was an odd thing to do given the circumstance.  “I fought for my life, don’t remember the stupid reason I was sent in.  Naturally.”
“ ‘Naturally’ indeed.”  Zaier shook his head and walked into the next room after turning down a hallway.
Feyria followed, and rapidly stopped next to him as they both swayed away from the huge edge they had come upon. There was an abyss below them in the next room.  They were on a balcony, and there was a walkway connecting to the far other side but it was a huge spherical room with a very long way down.
Far below them were thin rectangle plates, but at this distance it was hard to tell actual size.  They looked about as wide as a Solarian’s arms held out side to side, as thin as their hand, and the length was easily taller than two of them.  There was very little movement as one or two would rise up and something else would fall.
“Oh fuck…I know what this is,” Madigan muttered after following them in.
It was similar to a long, long deck of cards as a few would rise up and slowly sink down as the next ones did the same.  Long waves of these gold rectangles continued moving up and down far below.  It was rhythmic and entrancing, but also foreboding due to its alien nature.
“Aren’t those old power converters?” Feyria asked.
“Yeah,” Madigan turned to her, their typical tension gone at least for now.  “Super old school technology.  The only time I ever saw them were on old Aelisha Battleships.  The way old ones that have been around forever and are better than some modern ones.”
“I remember only learning about them…”
“So?” Zaier asked.
Madigan looked at him and explained as simply as he could, “This is slowly reactivating; we are in a crashed, ancient ship.”
 
Railine
Day-1, Dusk
Location: Reiko-10, Medical Lab

Railine felt like the meditations he had taken up for a large portion of his adult life were barely sufficient for the confusing situation he was now in.  The problem was he had somehow fallen into a leader role of this band of survivors.  Ryla was too young and Aria far too shy to act as leaders, and Laina was brash enough but the two of them did not agree.  
Railine had long held an insecurity of sorts towards her.  He was a generalist through and through, of which included medical training that would put even some of the best of pre-Sky Riot Terra/Earth medical practitioners to shame.  However, to a focused specialist like Laina he was inferior, a fact she made sure he knew in subtle or not so subtle ways very often.  She had saves he could never imagine, she knew techniques far beyond him; yet here he was acting in defiance against her base of knowledge.
“Do you know how much resources you are wasting on this?” she asked him.  “What are you even thinking?”
To Railine this was fighting an uphill battle.  In his mind it made sense but it was like a child telling an adult why their idea was superior to the adult’s life of experience.
“Railine, this isn’t a waste, is it?  Tell Laina it’s not,” Ryla pleaded.  Ryla was starting to convert to Laina’s side, only Aria was still with him completely.
Railine was holding a box, walking over to a counter when Laina slapped the box out of his hands.  It smashed to the floor hard; the room grew silent from the act.  “Stop!  Enough of this.  Solide is running around somewhere, we haven’t heard anything from the other crew, and you are wasting all these resources on some blood mix experiment?”
Railine was rarely angry but for a moment wanted to slap her.  It was that same latent rage he felt for his parents once, where violence was the only thing his mind could comprehend but knew how fruitless it was; it would change nothing.  He closed his eyes.  It didn’t matter if he attacked her, sending her to the floor in a single hit, she would still distrust and hate him, and he likely would lose what fleeting respect Ryla had for him.  Silently he bent down to grab the box, but she put her foot on it.
“Answer me!  I am not letting you use any of this on your stupidity!”
He stood up patiently.  “When we killed those things they didn’t bleed, not conventionally.  Solide seemed really convinced there was something wrong with Rox and one of us here.”
“Rox bled, you idiot!”
Railine nodded, not deterred at all by a woman he thought was a traitor.  “True, but there are a lot of androids that bleed various colors.”
Laina sighed audibly.  “So now Rox was an android?  She got killed by two point blank shots.  There is nothing to suggest anything odd about Rox, an android could have survived.”
Ryla piped up, “She’s right, what do you want to do with this?  We should save this if someone else is wounded…”
Railine smiled, ignoring Ryla.  He had Laina, she fell straight into his argument.  “That’s where you are wrong.  Only combat androids could have survived normally, and that’s assuming his weapon is only normal powered, which clearly his is of much higher power.  Meaning, it is entirely likely Rox was an android if not something else.  Regardless, we have a couple of different options to try here, UDT gel, blood paks, and the ReNew paks, all of which do NOT work conventionally on most androids.”
“I know that.”
“Do you?  Then you would know that all of these contain standard Solarian Nanite protocols in them, and mixing our blood with it will naturally activate them – unlike android to the same extent or, as I suspect, alien.”
“Haha…HAHAHA!!!”  Laina arched back laughing wildly.  “Calling you names is becoming tiring as they just continue raining down on you, all the while you are apparently unable to comprehend a comeback, but, as usual you don’t have a clue.  You are betting that Rox may have been an android or that there may be a reaction if we take those things’ ‘blood’.  Ryla, and you,” Laina didn’t know Aria’s name evidently as she pointed at her, “you have to see this is a dumb idea.”
Ryla was frowning.  “I don’t really get it.  Why wouldn’t it work on androids?”
Railine explained, “It does, but not the same extent.  Some androids have various suppressors in their system, especially if they were a former-Solarian, resurrected-type because their biologic nanite steady state is not their current state.  To say it bluntly, they were ‘dead’ once and the nanites have to be suppressed from thinking that is the state they are supposed to be at.  The suppressors would likely inhibit either of the Blood Pak or ReNew Pak protocols.”
Laina started tapping her forearm.  “If the blood sample came from shallow dermal depths of an android’s skin, you wouldn’t be able to tell, in case you didn’t know, which I suspect you didn’t.  You’d have to get a deep core or certainly sub-dermal sample to see any suppressors.  An android could fake your dumb little test easy by just getting a near-surface bleed.”
Railine ignored the taunts and bent down, pulling out a vial of red liquid.  “These blood paks are composed of emergency healing nanites and dense nutrients for replacement during major blood loss.  For a normal Solarian the reaction would be obvious.  Even with an android, it would react, but be slower, so you could tell.  No reaction, and it suggests not Solarian.”
“I doubt you even know half of what is in there.  I had to know all of that early in my career.  Do you have any idea of what is even in these?”  Laina pulled out a blue small rod; it was an injectable drug that everyone carried on military bases like this.  Called a ReNew pak, they were very advanced healing packages despite their size.  Extremely valuable, the one dose from them was capable of restoring tremendous injuries given the emergency nanites contained within them.
“You are acting like I don’t know that ReNew paks operate on the same technology as the blood pak, the absolute distillation of medical science
“Great you can name it,” Laina was not impressed in the slightest, “but do you have any idea how it works?”
Railine listed a few things off, “Similar to blood paks, they contain rapid healing nanites, fuel for the nanites, and a little bit of Booster protocols to shut down minor N-Limits.  It is kind of like causing the runaway nanite effect of the N-Limit, but controlling it for a very short period of time to save you, then shutting down all those nanites just injected.  They’re pretty valuable and expensive to make.  That’s why we each only have one.”
“Give me yours then,” Laina began, “I got an idea for an experiment.”
“No.”
She scoffed.  “Do you see your pathetic irony then?  Besides, you spout off a few common trivia facts about blood paks and ReNew paks and pretend you know something.”  She flipped her hair out of her face; it sprung back to the flared-to-the-right side edge it always had.
“Well Laina, you talk a lot, but are you ready to prove something?  I’m kind of curious what color your blood really is…”
He pulled a dish out and opened the vial of the blood pak, pouring a small portion of it into the dish.  “I am Solarian, and have nothing to hide.”  He un-slung his axe, lifting the blade in front of him and rubbing his left arm over the edge as the blood began dripping off of it.  Ryla took a step back from the display he was doing, gagging a little.  A few splashes of blood dripped into the dish and he backed off.
They watched as the blood slowly was surrounded by the contents of the vial that looked merely like blood itself, as it merged together.  “Naturally it is mixing with the blood as it was programmed to do.  Further…”  He spilled some more out of the vial and dumped it on the wound on his wrist, some splashing on the ground.  “These are capable of rapid healing.  Laina isn’t wrong that they are valuable.”  He took his hand and wiped the liquid off and the wound that was leaking blood was now completely sealed and looked vaguely scar-like.  “Highly impressive, but very expensive technology.”
“And a ReNew pak is even more expensive,” Laina chided him.
“Indeed.  That’s why I’m only using a blood pak.”
 “So now you wasted one on something every trauma person has seen.  Our sister base is dead, we know nothing about the other bases, and almost everyone on our base is missing and then you waste a pak on this ridiculous display.  Further, I like your little trick, as if this is supposed to clear you.  You in fact could be an android and merely avoided your deeper substrates.”
Railine was getting a rare pleasure in being able to out-think someone he had felt inferior to for a long time on her own ground.  “Thought you may say that, too.  Your problem is your intelligence blinds you to other’s actually being able to rival you.  That is a weakness of yours.”  He paused, savoring the moment.  “It’s always the weakness of types like you.”  He opened a box he had in front of him; in it were large size syringes.  “I have never seen an android that has anything beyond sub-dermal plating, and to prove to you, I’ll let someone else draw my blood to prove I am not an android either.  We will use the rest of this blood pak.”
“I’m best,” Laina said.
“Ha, you think I want you touching me?  I would trust Ryla way before I let you touch me.  Aria,” she dutifully came over, “if you will please take a sample from my arm, intra-osseous.”  He rested his arm on the counter as he stared at Laina, content he was forcing this issue by pure willpower.
Ryla looked very worried over what was happening and was completely sure she would not allow herself to be ‘tested’.  Aria stuck the long needle in; Railine did not even blink as it went deep.  The needle hit what was the bone, she pushed a little harder and Railine grunted as it slipped into the marrow, and she pulled a sample of blood out of what was presumed to be from within his bone.
“Aria,” he began, “either use the rest of this vial, or if you prefer to prove the validity of the test, take another vial and mix the two and tell me if it is a normal reaction.”
“Stop,” Laina said.  “Don’t waste it on that idiot.  I already know he is Solarian, as dumb as he is.”
“So you consent?” Railine asked, hopeful.
“No, I want to see what happens with one of those aliens, or Rox.”  Maybe Laina had finally come over to his side.
“Aria, what about you?” Railine asked, hoping she would side with him so he could force everyone now.  He didn’t know if this would work at all, but it seemed like it would.  The blood paks wouldn’t react to non-Solarian, and from there they might be able to find something out.  It was all based on a gut feeling from what Solide had said.
“…I’d prefer to try the aliens and Rox first.”
Railine was disappointed Aria showed hesitation.  Did she not believe it would work?  It hurt that she was doubtful.   He was a bit slowed down by his friend showing she was not completely behind him.  He grabbed some blood paks, a dish, and some syringes as they walked to where Rox had been murdered.
“It’s eerie thinking Solide is somewhere on this base,” Ryla said.  “Is he watching us?”
“He was your friend,” Railine said, maybe somewhat accusing.
“I misjudged him.”
“So did she,” Aria said in a moment of dry humor.  Below them was the shot body of Rox.  Ryla had turned her head and kept it that way the whole time, trying to not cry.
“Well, Doctor, how do you do that with a dead body?” Laina taunted.
“Her tissue can still be alive, ‘Doctor’,” Railine replied confidently as he bent down and took out the syringe, taking out a sample of blood from Rox.  He held the syringe up to the others, the red in the tube had once flowed in Rox.
“You are such an idiot.  Let me do this before you mess it up.”  Laina had come and bent down next to him.  She had a dish in one hand and held her open hand out to which Railine gave her the needle.
 She opened a new blood pak and dumped it into the dish before squirting the needle into it.  The two of them were mixed together as she swirled it rapidly.
Her eyes got wide as she stared at the dish.  “Uh….waaahh?  No…this means…”
“What!?”  Ryla asked in shock.
Her fake surprised look faded as she pointed to Railine.  “Means he’s an idiot.  It’s normal.”  Laina scoffed.  “Just regular blood.”  She swirled it a bit more.  “Want to see?  See what a dumb idea this is?”  She waited a moment, and then threw the dish angrily into the stack of furniture.  “Nothing, which makes him an idiot, and that psycho Solide a murderer!”
“This is what is expected right?” Ryla asked.
“Yeah…”  Railine started worrying; what exactly was he thinking was going to happen again?
Laina had been kneeling down, but stood up and walked over to one of the bodies.  She took her sword and cut off the Solarian-like arm and brought it over.  It was grotesque holding an arm that looked so close to their own.  “It’s not bleeding, so what now?”  Laina squeezed it hard, the muscles in her hand evident as the veins throbbed out ever so slightly; however nothing came out of the alien arm.
“I…am not sure.”  
“Great…”  She knelt down, sighing. “Let me try to help you, to put this stupid idea to rest.”  Taking a syringe and stabbing it into the arm, pulling out the plunger.  Only nothing filled the container.  “What do we do now?  Your idea is bunk, and I can’t condone you wasting such valuable gear on an idea that isn’t working.”
Railine felt his idea deflating and dejected.  He had one last idea.  He took the arm and slashed it on his axe leaving a deep cut on the already dead arm.  There was no blue stuff that came out like the first time they fought them.  Regardless he took the remnants of his vial and dumped it on the cut.
“Stop wasting it!” Laina yelled.
“What should happen?” Ryla asked, confused as she was not nearly as medically inclined.
“It shouldn’t heal… I think.”  The pause killed what little momentum he had left.
Laina was now on the offensive, “That’s assuming these things aren’t mutated Solarians, which, given their face, why do you think that?”
Railine was thinking in circles now, because what exactly did it prove if the wound wasn’t healed?  Or even if it was, it meant this thing was once one of them, interesting certainly but…Laina’s doubts were filling his mind.  He actually was under-gunned mentally on medical knowledge, and he was simply overpowering a bunch of girls with his size, strength, and will.  Blowing pak after pak on these tests and the ones destroyed by that creature were a real cost that could have saved some bad wounds if administered correctly.
After longer than necessary, he wiped the liquid away but felt it before he saw it that the ridge was still there in the humanoid arm.  The cut remained.  He could not be completely sure if a body was actually dead if it would still try to heal tissue damage, but for most intents was sure it should have.  Maybe…
“Railine…” Aria softly spoke.  “I am not sure this is going to work.  It may be best if you stopped.”
“I gave you the benefit of the doubt and even helped you, but the facts speak for themselves right now,” Laina said.
Railine did not lift his head.  “Ryla, you are next.”  His voice was cold; he knew what had to be done.  Let justice be done though the heavens may fall.
“What!?  Me?”  She took one step back, then another slower, almost stumbling step.
He turned and looked deranged; he was so close to something key here but it was slipping away from him.  “Yes, you.”
“No, she is not doing this,” Laina said.
He stood up and grabbed Laina’s wrist.  “You’re taking it too, Laina.  How about you first?”
She twisted her wrist out and stepped away from him.  “No, I am not.”
“You are taking this!” he yelled.
“You have wasted two valuable blood paks on absolutely nothing!  You set up all those other supplies to get destroyed!  No one else here supports this idea anymore, you dumb ape.”
He grabbed his axe and un-slung it from behind him, brandishing it in front of him.  “Three more tests.”
She whipped her Nano-Blade out in front of her.  “No, you are out of control just like Solide.”
There was a smile on his face some may have described as psychotic.  “You are right, I don’t care about the others; I only want one more, and that’s you.”
“It will prove nothing.”
Aria and Ryla stood a safe distance away from the two of them.  Railine was big and muscular and his axe would cleave her apart, but she was fast and a Nano-Blade didn’t need strength behind it.
Railine’s tone was dark and committed, “Solide was convinced someone on the other crew was what he called a ‘Death Angel’.  The only one it could be was Kalco, as Zaier was in Reiko-7 only for a bit and Feyro never went in while Madigan was with me.  That leave’s Kalco…and you.  I’ve already proved I am Solarian.”
“Your test is flawed and has shown nothing.”
“You are submitting to this test, you bitch.”  The profanity was rare for him and indicative of the stress getting to them in the situation.
“Or what, you will kill me?  Kill me so you can get a sample like Rox?  You let her die.”
That line was the final straw.  Given she had been the one to let her die, that string of words angered him deeply and he charged at her, swinging as she parried two hits with her blade, the axe crashing into the floor hard.  She had speed, but his strength was overpowering her.
“Stop it!” Ryla yelled.  She ran between the two of them, holding her arms out.  The little girl would not be much of a burden but morally he could not attack her.  Or perhaps so she hoped.
“I can’t trust you anymore,” Laina said.  She lowered her blade slightly as she took a few steps back.  “I am going back to the medical room to run a few tests, because I think there may be something to your otherwise stupid idea.  However, I don’t ever want to see you again, if that is at all possible.”
“That’s fine, I don’t trust you either.”  He lowered his axe and went to turn away.  Only the little Ryla stopped him from a desire to force Laina at the point of violence.
“Wait, you guys need to try talking this out!”  Ryla yelled.
“Nothing more to say,” Railine said.  “I don’t trust her, and I’d fight to that point, excluding wanting to you hurt you.  If you trust her, that is to your peril.”
“What are you going to do?”
“I am going to find Solide.”  Railine’s words hung in the air for a while; he knew it would be polarizing.  For Ryla, it was the words that sealed her choice of whether or not to go with him.
“Railine…I can’t go with you.”
“I understand.  I harbor no ill will towards you.”  He turned to Laina.  “I have only one thing to ask, and it’s for Ryla’s sake.  If I see you anywhere else other than the Beta wing I am going to treat you as hostile, and my request is if you see Solide in that wing, send him my way and as return I will stay out of there.”
“Some deal.”
“Do you accept!?”  He paused a moment.  “Those are the conditions,” he said strongly.  “Ryla, if you see Solide send him to find me.  He knows way more than he is letting on.  He is the key here.  I still urge you come with me.”
“What is Aria doing?” the young girl asked.
The small-framed sniper with her long hair spoke easily if not quietly.  “I am friends with Railine, I will not abandon him.”
It caused Ryla to pause for a moment.  “Railine, I can’t go with you.  I hate Solide for killing Rox and I have a hard time trusting someone like you, who would resort to violence.”
Railine bit his lip and nodded once.  It was pointless to try to convince her that his patience had endured Laina’s abuse for more than anyone should have.  It was a bitter irony of his general philosophic bent to avoid violence, and here was a girl abandoning him because of a rare tendency.  “Bye, Ryla.”
This was the last time they would see each other alive.
Feyria
Day-1, Dusk
Location: Ancient Ship

“Heuhhhhh….heuhhhhhh…”  Zaier held a hand on his chest as he was leaning into the wall, breathing hard.  He stood up, and despite the tough exterior, she knew he was pushing on mostly through pride.  “Kalco is lying, you know.”
Feyria had been bent over, poking through containers in a corner when she stood up.  “What do you mean?”
The small group of four had spilt into two to better search the ship.  Feyria quickly volunteered to stay with Zaier, and he was happy to have his intimate friend with him; neither of the other two men felt the need to argue as they split paths.  Feyria and Zaier were on the same level in what might be some sort of control room.  They did not have to walk far from where they started, mostly just across the walkway which, despite the seeming unsafe passage, the repulsion technology was still active as visible fields appeared if anyone got too close to the edge.
“His story, he is so full of it.”
Feyria averted her eyes, pretending she was still looking for something valuable.  They actually had found some useable weapons; seemed like Aelisha tech but she could not be sure.  She found some light battle armor that adapted to her form, sealing tight around her coat and leaving her curves hardly obscured despite now having protection of some unknown level on.
The problem was she liked both of these men, having been intimate with both.  Neither knew it, or at least said anything.
“Is that so?”
Zaier was tying a string of explosives together that Feyria for some reason had stashed on the V-Plane.  He was rigging them to all go off together; if it worked it would be a pretty potent explosion.
“If half of what he said was true, I would have heard about it.”
“I could see why you would be mad,” she responded.  To her the two men represented different but intriguing ideals.  Kalco was the flirty, cocky jock types she used to get with all the time back in the academy.  Their cockiness and brashness were unwarranted but there was something alluring in how much they believed their own illusion.  Zaier was the dark, mysterious type that had intellect and a different kind of power behind him.  Oh…why was she being forced to choose right now?
“Do you even know what ‘Marked’ is?”  His condescending attitude at times was actually an occasional a charm of his, she laughed to herself.
“No.”
“Well, it’s not as ‘rumored’ as he said.  We are not sure why it happens, but certain locations or events will ‘Mark’ some.  The biggest sign is their hair turns white.”
“My hair is pretty light.” She threw a hand through it, the wave fell down to near her butt.
“Pure white.  A lot of this gets super covered up, but apparently it activates some latent talents in us.  These people are recorded having pretty amazing feats of strength.  Intellect is harder to read about post-action but it seems to be an increase there as well.”
She threw a couple of interesting items over near him and kept poking around.  “That seems good.”
“Well, here is where it gets scary: almost all of these people get killed very soon after.”
Feyria froze, actually serious for a moment.  “By what?”
“By something similar to what have seen.”
Her heart jumped.  “These ‘Death Angels’?  Kalco said it was the ‘truer version’ of the thing we saw at Ten.”
“Not sure.  The evidence is very, very sparse.  Even the rare video is usually the same: a person is walking along, then they are rapidly killed in bloody fashion by some figure.  I am making a jump here, but I saw one or two videos that makes me think they are connected.  Here is the major problem: no one knows what the things that killed the ‘Marked’ truly are.  They do not match any known alien race, there is no ship they come on, and even some of their bodies break down after a while which makes research difficult.”
“Some?  Are you saying they fade away?” she asked.
“Eh…I don’t want to say exactly, but I certainly can’t deny that isn’t happening.  Gah….”  He held his shoulder for a moment and slowly took his hand off.  “But yes, they just fade away into nothingness, kind of like they seem to have come. Maybe it is the air is toxic or something, but of the few that are ever recovered, but they eventually just break down.”
“I don’t get it, so people randomly get targeted by creatures that fade away?”
“Well, no one really understands what is happening.  These people get targeted and killed, even sometimes in heavy military bases.  There is not an invasion or entry, more like these things appear near the person, kill them, and then gone without a trace.”
“And there never was anyone around?  No video?”
“Oh no, sometimes there is, and yes, people wind up dead often when in proximity to the target.  I am high ranked, but there is a lot kept even from me.  As a result, I have only seen a little, of which I know there are a few times at least that these mutated creatures were killed.  They are not invincible, as we saw ourselves.  But, the bodies just do not stay in corporeal form.”
“They go away?”  She put her hand on her hip.  “Don’t tell me something dumb like the creatures bodies are about to go to a research station for examination and then when no one is looking they disappear.”
“No, it’s quite documented.  It is like that thing we fought where it came from nothing and manifested into reality, only the death is reversed.  Their bodies are here, but fade from existence.  They lose their essence and dwindle away, becoming less and less solid.  The bodies are real at first, people can pick them up, prod them and so on; but as time goes on, they get lighter and there is less to them, then eventually just fall apart.  It reminds me of ash in a way, you burn a log and arguably the log isn’t there anymore either.”
“Yeah, but you are ignoring the energy that was relished in the fire.”
He nodded, “Which makes me think energy is some part of what is happening here.  Kalco said something about fire or explosives being effective, maybe there is some connection there.”
Feyria asked a different question “Does everyone who becomes Marked die?”
“No, that’s where a big piece of the puzzle was put together by the Federation.  Eventually they figured out there were locales or ‘gates’ so to say with these things where it was the only place they could appear.  Mind you I am often talking about a whole planet.  If someone Marked can get far enough away from those areas, almost always where the Marking originally took place, they appear to be safe.  There are quite a few people out there who were Marked and escaped, and will likely be fine.”  He paused for a moment.  “Assuming they don’t get close to another gate in their life.”
She shuttered a bit.  “Ugh, why did you have to add that last part?  I was feeling hopeful.  So what are these gates?  Wormholes or something?”
“Well, just a term really, but astrologically all incidents take place in very specific areas.  As far as I know, there is no pattern of their locations; there could be a lot of gates in one area solar system, and completely nothing at a nearby system.  However the correlation to past incidents has been a nearly perfect predictor of further incidents.  This is what led to the conclusion about it being location dependent.  If you ever saw that there were a lot of mining or military outposts that have been abandoned recently, this is largely why.”
Her face looked intensely sad, “Wiped out or abandoned?”
He shrugged, “Probably both.  Reiko looks like it is on the ‘wiped out’ path though.”
“Where does Terra fall in this?  I haven’t heard anything like this.”
“You’re Terran aren’t you?”
“Yes, I am,” she said with pride like all Solarians did who were from the home planet.
Zaier had stopped for a while, collecting his thoughts through the pain he was in.  “So far there has been nothing at Terra.”  Feyria sighed.  They were both silent for a while when he changed topics “I heard that Terrans are given slightly better AGEing than others, think that’s true?”
“I’d like to think so.”
“Reminds me that I heard Aelisha engineer themselves better as well as having better nanites then they let us have.”  Feyria had noted a while ago that Zaier seemed to have a slight hesitation when it came to the Aelisha, the slightest distrust.  She had seen it before in the self-sufficient type like he was with their general disdain of authority over themselves.
Silence had overtaken them again while they dutifully explored the ship.  It had been a very long time since it had been touched.  Small currents of wind had brought snow into certain areas, and the moisture from somewhere had frozen much of the floor and ceiling.  The fact the ship was slowly warming up was an odd scene in some rooms with the icicles dripping or low-lying fog. 
Eventually, they had completed this floor, and only had to wait for Kalco and Madigan to come back.  The two of them went back to the long walkway, it was oddly entrancing.
Zaier spoke bluntly, “We have spent enough time together to dispense with some of the pleasantries.  Among them, knowing that you are smarter than you let on.”
She giggled, swishing her hair a bit.  “Come on, don’t ruin my bimbo cover here.”
“I don’t think anyone doubted your coordination or athleticism, which I think is a big part of ‘bimbo’ status.”
“Aww, you know what I mean.”
“Some hot athlete girl they just want to fuck?” Zaier didn’t swear often.
“Ohhh…I like when you talk dirty to me.”
He leaned against the energy railing, watching the ancient alien tech move silent below them.  Any moment it could disappear and he would die from the fall.  “Here is a question I think about a lot: can morality be reduced to ‘good versus evil’?”
“That is a question I can’t answer.”
He looked at her firmly.  “Don’t play coy with me.”
“I’m being serious,” she said, “I would answer that the question is complicated.”  He stared at her until she elaborated.  “I don’t believe in shades of gray, so to answer your question ‘yes’; however I am not sure there is ‘evil’ either.  I hate those words.  From their point of view, it might be quite justified; taking a different perspective it’d be easy to see that your side is the ‘good’ side.”
“Heh…”  He closed his eyes, his hand drifting up to his shoulder for a moment, scratching it.  “Not sure the sticher is holding.  I can feel something wrong with my tissue.”
She came over, softly putting her hand on his shoulder as she rubbed it.  “Want me to look at it?”
“No.  No point.  I don’t want your touch right now.”  He clenched his teeth in pain for a moment, “I like talking better.  I’ve always got more kicks above the waistline…”
She frowned.  “I wasn’t coming onto you,”
“I know, but right now I’d rather you talk.”  His face showed a bit of pain before forcing it to relax.
“About what?”
“Morality,” he stated.  “I’ve done things I was told was right, but the older I become, the more I see it was  very wrong from a different perspective.  Is fighting for survival truly ‘good’?”
It was hard for her to tell if he was merely forcing the conversation, or perhaps to someone intellectual like him it was a legitimate good distraction.
“Sure, I guess.  I don’t like that word though.”
“What if I had to stomp a race I felt was evil out?”
“Are they evil?”
“Does it matter?” he asked back.  “You’re the one who said you don’t like those words.”
She shook her head; it was a sight he rarely tired of.  Her hair was very nice.  She really played up the idiot hottie role, perhaps as some defense, but she actually was quite a catch when it came down to it.  “I can’t say anyone was justified, because everyone feels like they are doing the right thing.”
He looked away from her.  “Yeah, I agree.  I came to that conclusion a while ago.  The people or aliens I was fighting against probably had just as good of a reason to kill me.”  Zaier’s eyes were open but he was not really seeing anything.  “What was I even fighting for?”
“Were you sympathetic towards whoever you fought?”  She asked him.  The way Zaier talked at times, it was clear he was some type of ex-soldier as well.  Not a fighter-type like Kalco, but maybe some sort of intel officer or something.
“No.  Maybe amoral.  I was fighting for my survival and that of my races’.  And the Aelisha.”
“Always the Aelisha,” she agreed, but then realized her sincere agreement might not be what Zaier had meant.  “But do you still think that?”
“No, I don’t.  I have begun to realize there is a higher purpose to our actions.  That some of the things we do, may in fact have ‘more value’ than other options or morals we follow.”
“I agree!” she said, surprised.
 “I don’t think you fully know what I’m talking about…”
“Well, I already told you, I think everyone is fighting for their own good, so it’s kind of a wash and nothing means anything.  Some sort of ‘unmorality’ if that’s a word.”
“It’s not.”
She continued undaunted, “I am saying that if everything means the same, then nothing has value; but if something had some sort of value, then it would have greater meaning to me, even if it wasn’t what we would call more.  I’d be quite sympathetic to that cause!”
He laughed a bit, before coughing stopped him.  “Hard to believe I would just have sex with you because you were hot and indulged my sadistic tendencies, but that you actually have some similar esoteric philosophical leaning.”
“Philosophical?  No, I wouldn’t say that at all.  Just most of life seems pointless to me, everything has the same value, meaning everything is worthless.  I realized if I could find something, anything, that had any sort of value, that would be the best thing to go for.  None of that mattered with us though, I found you attractive and it made me happy to see you happy.  Maybe I got a little something out of it, too.”   Smiling slyly, she visibly swayed her butt a few times.  “I don’t suppose we’ll get to finish the ‘guess the object’ game…”
“Yeah…probably not.”
“Too bad.”  She came over to the railing, putting an arm around him as they both looked down, memorized by the rhythm.
They stayed in silence for a long while.
He started talking again.  Same stuff about reasoning and logic and all that, she was not a fan but card about him so listened sincerely.  “Does it bother you that my reasoning could be different than your rationale, but it could lead to the same conclusion many might regard as bad or wrong?”
“What are you saying?”
“I am saying, in my belief, the meaning of something gives it value.  If its purpose meant so much to see it accomplished, that is what gives it value to be fought for.  To you, it is an inversion.  You will fight for something that appears to have value in a meaningless existence, and that value is what gives the meaning.”
“Isn’t that the same?  I’m not good at splitting hairs like this.”
“Worlds different.”
“Does that mean you don’t want me?”
“Hardly, just our rationale is different.  To say it bluntly, yours is the type that is the fanatical follower…”
“…You never were good at keeping your mouth shut.”
He laughed once.  “You either.  Why the past tense?”
“No reason, just accepting our situation here.  If you got any ‘big plans’ for me, Mr. Leader, let’s hear them.  I could use some value.”
“Let me play devil’s advocate, and start with the assumption that we are fighting for the wrong side.”
“Oh this should be fun!”  She swayed her butt a few times as she continued to lean on the gate and one-arm hug Zaier; she was glad to be spending time with a man she loved but would never bring herself to say it.
“To begin, how would you know if you are fighting on the wrong side…?”



 
Railine
Day-1, Night
Location: Reiko-10, bunkered center room

The first thing out of Railine’s mouth was, “Sorry.”
She was silent like usual before slowly replying, “It is okay.”
To both of them there was no question about ‘why did you choose me?’ or anything similar because they were deep friends and it was simply a matter of course.  Railine was not sure if she would fight to the death for him – that was a bit of an extreme qualifier – but he felt like he would risk quite a lot for her sake.
“Was I wrong?”  He had carefully opened one door, his axe in his right hand as the door swung wide.  The workshop was completely empty, it had an eerie feel to it with some tools scattered on workbenches.  A weapon was torn down in the process of being modified, its owner long gone one way or another.  
“I am sorry,” she said.
“Why?” he asked confused.
“I just am not sure that would show us things we really wanted to see.  Perhaps it was better to leave things off unknown.”
Railine narrowed his eyes, but did not turn to face her.  “What do you mean?”
She did not immediately answer.
He continued, “Aria, are you hiding something from me?”
“You lack subtly,” she said.  “Sometimes the best option is to sit back, observe and only then strike decisively.  Do we even know what these Death Angels are?”
Railine had walked through the workshop.  “Solide?” he called, but there was only silence and the uncaring light over-head.  “What does that have to do with the test?”
Aria put it straight to him as he walked right within the sniper’s sights: “What if Ryla or Laina was one of them?  We were in no position to fight if we found something we did not want to see.”
He paused, noting she had a good point, but was not fully sure what she meant.
Aria walked over to one of the benches, grabbing some tools.  “Mind if I adjust my rifle here?”
“Will it take long?”
She shook her head no, and the movement flowed smoothly like a river down her long black hair.  She scavenged some parts off the table, and set to quick work as she was changing something on the receiver on her rifle.
“You call that thing a name, don’t you?”
“ ‘Broken Promise’,” was her simple reply.
Railine peeked into the next room over.  “Solide?”  He came back.  “You don’t forgive very easily, I assume.”
“Not a matter of forgiveness.”
“Maybe to yourself?” he asked rhetorically.  There was a scampering sound and Railine whipped his axe forward as he spun around.  There he saw one of the dogs at the door, wagging its tail.  He sighed, on edge.
“Mostly.”  She didn’t say anything for a while.  “Assuming Solide is not crazy, he knows something.  Railine,” using his name was rare for her, “he comes off as a Classed Soldier so blatantly to me.”
Railine knew Aria was a former Class Solider, which were a special operations division in the Solarian military.  They had brutal training, often died in missions, and for some reason seemed to get phased out after not too long; that kind of explained why Aria was here.  To Railine there was no way to be sure Aria was not still on some sort of mission, he didn’t know.
Aria cycled the action on her rifle a few times, it rang solidly.  “Kalco is also, but anyone who was Classed would pick it up.  He never directly states it, but the missions he was on were way too high to be anything but.  I’d guess former Leader.  Solide though, he rarely talks and keeps to himself, but he has eyes that suggests…”  She was careful with her words.  “He never left Classed…or went even deeper into something I may not even know about.”
There were a lot of subjects she was suddenly bringing up, and there was the larger point she made at the beginning about if Ryla or Laina was actually whatever crazy Solide was calling ‘Death Angels’.
“Are you still Classed anymore?” he asked instead.
“No…we don’t stay active too long actually.  The casualty rate is pretty high, the secrecy is pretty paramount, and believe it or not, you only need to serve a short term before you can get out and expenses covered the rest of your life.”
“Why are you here then?” he asked.
“They faze people out in a step down.  This is my last stint then I am home free.”  She slapped a piece into her rifle and a rare smile came over her face.  She looked girlish, Railine realized as he looked at her before blushing and turning away.
“What’d you do?”
“I changed a bit of the firing mechanism, and took some of the limiters off the conducting rails.”
Railine came over, resting a hand on her shoulder.  “Come on, we need to find Solide.”
“You trust him?”
“Not really at all, but I have a feeling he knows something, and sounds like you think he does too.”  He changed the subject hesitantly.  “Why were you hesitant at the blood draw?”
“We were outgunned if something happened.”
Railine thought he followed, but was not sure.  “What do you mean?”
“While you are quite capable with your axe, and Broken Promise is potent, what if Ryla or Laina was a Death Angel?  I suspect these would not be enough.  We needed time.”
Railine saw the wisdom in it.  He was so desperate for an answer, that perhaps he was not ready to accept what the answer may have been.  “Good point.”
“I hope you realize I had my reasons.”
“I do.  But what now?”
She lifted Broken Promise with one hand, Railine noting she was very strong for her thin frame.   “Well I feel much more comfortable with the limiter off, but we need some better equipment.”
He walked towards the door, leading the two of them when he stopped; she paused a few steps behind him.  “…”  Railine let out a little sigh before speaking solemnly, “Rox…could have been saved…couldn’t she have?  You knew it too when you said she could have been res-ed.”  The question was interesting because he was no slouch at all when it came to medical knowledge but he was outclassed by both Aria and especially Laina.
“I thought so.”
Railine took a huge breath in, closing his eyes as his fist gripped tightly.  His closed eyes and the burn scars on his otherwise young face added to the intensity of the anger he was suppressing.
He might have asked, ‘Why didn’t you say anything?’ but this was shy Aria and it was obvious why; the one he couldn’t forgive though was himself.  “I have a different question.  You thought if it could have been Ryla or Laina, but why?”
Aria brushed her hair out of her other eye for a moment while she quietly looked at Railine.  “She likely let Rox die, no doubt about that, and it serves two points for her: one less person alive, and it leaves an extra Res Kit around for herself.”
Railine scoffed, shaking his head.  “Unbelievable, letting someone die because you think only about yourself.  That selfishness strikes a bit too close to home with people I once knew”  His eyes were lifted up towards the roof, clearly thinking about something other than what was right in front of him.  “Anyway, I will keep the two of them in mind due to you, but the person I don’t trust most is Kalco.  At all.”
Aria was neutral on the subject.  “Why?  I don’t see it.”
“You said he is a military Classed Soldier.  That adds to my point; however consider who is he with: Madigan, Zaier, and that pilot Feyra.”  Aria looked puzzled at him.  “You have never been one to understand social cues or power dynamics, but there were an odd number of high ranked people that survived in the ten of us.  Zaier, obviously, Kalco, Madigan and Ryla.  The last two don’t show it or act it, but both of them are on various fast tracks due to their skills.  Did you know Ryla actually outranks Kalco?”
“I was aware,” Aria said, “she has some savant skills certainly, but her age and naivety does not lend themselves well to survival situations like this.  No one would willingly follow her lead right now”
Railine nodded, pressing the point.  “Exactly, in a lot of ways she is easy to push around.  Imagine a situation where Kalco comes back as the ‘sole survivor’ of that group, and suddenly he is highest ranked person that has any legitimate claim to leadership.”
“I don’t think that matters now.”
“Does it?  What if a sister base is still alive?  What if nearly any situation beyond pure anarchy reigning requires a ‘leader’?  He is the man.”
“That seems quite a stretch.”
“I have good intuition.  Just file it away if something like that happens.”
“What if it is only someone like Madigan?”
“Trust him then!” Railine laughed, rubbing her hair slightly.  “Just kidding, I trust him, but that would be suspicious as well, but I don’t see it happening.”  He nodded and they headed towards the weapons locker in the main room where there were a few bodies scattered, including Rox’s.  He paused to look down Beta Wing, perhaps hoping for a glimpse of Laina or little Ryla.  The two of them walked into the next room where some weapons were stored.
“Don’t imagine Zaier would be opposed to us taking anything we can,” Railine said.
“Doubt it,” she said shortly.
They both were lightly armored, but the situation had changed that they needed more protection.  He watched as she slipped a larger protective vest over her torso, and put on some light leg armor.  The body armor shifted and tightened down to her lithe frame, even if it was hidden by the advanced winter coat.  She grabbed a few grenades as well as an energy weapon of some kind.
Even though he had been here before, this was not a familiar place to Railine so he hesitantly opened a couple doors.  Random rifles, rocket launchers, flame throwers, and energy weapons stared back at him.  The next couple contained variations of armor, including fully enclosed power suits.  He was a ways away from being able to handle equipment like that, as he would need way more practice.  Railine took a similar light armor setup as Aria, lifting it over his head as the straps auto-adjusted, and the pieces of leg and core armor tightened around him in a way that encumbered him little.
Aria asked him when it was obvious this was not his strong suite.  “Are there any weapons you are skilled with beyond axes?” Compared to a soldier like her, he was not.  “I assume you were taught the Pulse Rifle, if nothing else.”  All Solarians in general are trained in a sufficient understanding of combat – a necessity in a harsh universe where nearly every race beyond the Aelisha wanted them dead.
Railine pulled one weapon out of the pack, it was a thin fuel cylinder connected to a narrow barrel terminating in a nozzle.  Railine rolled the Jetstream flamethrower in his hands with a poise that suggest it was not his first time with the weapon.  “I am pretty good with a few, all things considered.  Always had a knack for explosive or flame throwers, ironically.  Guess I should just stick with what I know.”  Taking a look at the fuel gauge, he put it down to go look for some fuel.
“It is ironic,” she agreed, knowing his past of being a fire fighter and how he lost his sister.  Aria was watching him as he quite competently hefted the flame thrower, attaching a new fuel tank, turning the switch to light the pilot as he lowered it back down; even the armor around his winter clothes suited him well.  “If your mentality was slightly different, I think you would have made a good Assault.”
“If it means being like Solide, not sure I want it.”
“You have the calmness of a Sniper, but the drive of an Assault.”  She smiled softly at him.  “It’s cool to see.”
Their talking was interrupted by a soft growling of one of the dogs near them.  Its hackles were raised as it was growling towards the door out into the snow.  Aria lifted her rifle, and Railine did the same with his new weapon.
The tension grew as they did not know what was coming, and the dog only growled louder.  He tensed, ready to pull the trigger and deliver a fiery death to whatever was on the other side.
Slowly the moments trickled by.  The dog barked a few times which tried his nerves even more.
Any moment he expected something to come dashing in.  The first sight of anything and he would fry it.  His breaths were coming faster and faster in anticipation.
There was a loud crash, and the dog jumped forward, barking right next to the door.
“Get back!” Railine yelled.  The tension was unbelievable as at any instant whatever was there would come through.
It banged again.  Railine took a step forward, grabbing the dog in one hand and suitcasing it back towards Aria for its own protection as he stepped back, leveling his weapon again.  He barely had it up when the door flung open and multiple black things began charging through.  Aria and Railine were ready as her newly upgraded rifle exploded a hypervelocity round out that blew a few of them in a line apart.
Railine’s Jetsteam shot a narrow path of lit flame as he covered the group in flammable death.  The hardship they had encountered previously with just one of the creatures created a distorted metric for this easy victory they had just achieved.  The four or five charred and shot bodies were defeated in a way that made it look easy, when in reality it was the stronger weapons and the advance warning they had along with overlapping fields of fire.
An oddity seemed to be that the bodies, upon some level of catching fire, seemed to cause a complete self-immolation. Similar to logs that are in the process of charring, a small blue or red line would move up the body leaving nothing behind as it dissolved.  The entire creature was consumed by whatever process was occurring.  Not all of them did this, only the ones that Railine had burned to death.
Railine was breathing hard again, ready for whatever was next at any moment.
Nothing had immediately come.  He started smiling; maybe they could successfully turn this around yet.  With some better gear and some preparation they won in a decisive way.
“We did it…!”
“Something’s coming…” Aria warned.
Railine snapped his face forward back to the door as some blue and pink angular shapes flew into view.  
“Shit…” Railine swore uncharacteristically.  Appearing in front of them as it phased straight through the wall, they were staring at a creature that looked fairly humanoid, even if it was floating about knee-height in the air.  It was bipedal, and its arms and legs looked fairly feminine like its torso did.  From its back were things perhaps most easily described as ‘wings’ even if they were not physically connected.  They looked more like two diagonal rods with diamond-shaped spikes coming down from them.
The creature was beautiful in one way, but terrifying with the uncanny similarity to Solarians.  It had long hair that slowly drifted as if pushed by an invisible wind, and the face looked elfish with two longer slanted ears.  In another way that was oddly Solarian, there was a dark smirk on its obscured face.  The eyes were not visible under the long bangs short of an occasional movement of its hair.
The two of them fired nearly as fast as he had swore.  Her sniper rifle rounds rang loudly just as he held the trigger down on a wave of flame.  What was obvious quite quickly was that angel creature did not seem ‘there’ in any normal sense.  Aria’s rounds were hitting it, but the only reaction was light blue steam coming off its backside while the rounds hit the far wall.  Railine’s flames were drowning it, but almost to no affect.
The thing raised its hand as energy started gathering in the air above it.  Railine felt a hand on his shoulder, realizing it was Aria.  “Run!” she yelled.
The two of them dashed out the weapon room back into the center of the base.  Where the dog went, he had no idea.  
“Keep running!” Aria tugged him, they turned and headed down Delta Wing, and his mind just kept repeating ‘It’s a Death Angel!  It’s a Death Angel!’
“What are we going to do!?”
“I have no idea,” she answered, panicked as was unusual for her.
They kept running, Aria ahead of him as they dodged through rooms.  
Railine started falling forward as something was not working correctly.  Ahead of him, Aria quickly turned another corner.  He crashed to his knee, and felt something else in his chest.  He looked down and there was a pink thin dagger of glass poking out of his ribs.  With his left hand he touched it.  Was this his blood, his organs?  Was this armor nothing?
Aria poked her head back in when he was not behind her.  “Railine!”  She started towards him, then froze, staring at what was behind him.  He knew already.
“Aria…Ru…nnn…” he coughed out, falling to the side, summoning all of his mighty will as he turned to the right.  He squeezed the trigger as he bathed the Death Angel in flames, to what avail he did not know.  But if he could die helping his friend, he would.
Once again to Railine it rained flame around him until he blacked out, this time permanently.

 
Madigan
Day-1, Night
Location: V-Plane heading towards Sensor Anomaly

The lights of the V-Plane played off of Madigan’s face as he mechanically flipped a few switches and went back to scanning the outside with occasional glances at the various glowing panels.  Contact with the base was still non-existent due to atmospheric disturbance.  He loosely wondered how everyone was doing there given the new enemy they fought at the ancient ship.  Slow pulses of red lights would light up the otherwise dark cockpit and gave the man with not-so-latent anger issues a focused look.
The two men were heading to another location that was generating strange readings after the exploration of the ship had been partially complete.  Zaier and Feyria were in the process of taking care of the rest, and Zaier insisted they press on to find out as much info as they could about what was happening.  Extreme caution was advised, and he left it up to them but suggested just a flyby as a minimum.
Kalco was to Madigan’s right, staring out the window as he slowly tapped his fingers in a wave against his arm rest.  “Why isn’t flying automatic?” he lazily asked.
“A lot of vehicles are.”
“Well, so what exactly is your role?”
Madigan wasn’t sure if that was a backdoor insult, but gave him the benefit of the doubt for now; if he was a woman he would not have been so forgiving.
“To adapt to emerging situations, mainly.”
Kalco turned to look at him.  “What I mean is, you are still doing a lot.  I know they make drones that can fly themselves, and I’ve even rode in autonomous planes in combat zones.”
“Sure, but ultimately, based on changing conditions or if quick adaptation required, a Solarian will always be superior to machine algorithms.”
“Then why not just press a button and still retain control when the situation goes bad?  Why do you need to know anything about it?”
“They tried that.  Pre-Sky Riots actually.  They found that the more automated the flying was, the less the pilot knew; consequently the less they could actually do when something went wrong.  We are reduced certainly, but there is still a role we play.  Besides, I’m a pilot only until I get out of this dump and to a Starship to command.”
“Oh…you’re one of those big shots…”  Kalco’s voice had the faintest bit of derision in it.
“Yes, one of those,” Madigan said firmly back to him.  It was forceful enough Kalco did not bother pursuing.
It was silent for a while, and then Madigan added, “This stuff can be automatic, like Feyria always has a Grav-Beacon on her.  It’s a remote or auto pilot device, to put it simply.  Those things are great.  They have the ability to modify the ship’s inertial comps, which is something I can’t do, but they lack the intuition to say…”  Madigan shoved the plane down, and they were now flying very close to the ground as they narrowly passed through mountain ranges.
Kalco’s eyes got wide for a moment, and gripping the seat, he tried to calm himself out of pride of not looking scared.
Madigan continued, “…know that this ground path is not only faster, and that up where we were…” they pulled up now, “would have been a very dangerous cross-wind based on the terrain.”
Kalco looked back out the window, changing topics.  “I don’t feel good about what we did with Zaier and Feyria.”
“I could care less, as long as they get it done.”  His voice matched the words, in that he could truly care zero about the two they left behind.
There was something Kalco was trying to get at, “It’s not like me to doubt things, but something felt off about that whole thing.  Was that really our best option?”
Madigan shook his head. “Why are you talking about this now?  You were the one who said it was okay and that we will just come back for them.”
The situation they had left had taken a surprising turn.  Something was occurring in the ship that was turning it on after a very long slumber.  There was no way to tell how long it would take to warm up, or that if it was even space-worthy after being frozen in the ice for eons.  The one thing they all agreed on though, was because none of them started it, it was likely not in their interest to have it going.
Zaier laid the plan out pretty logically, if not coldly.  Having rigged as many explosives as they could find from Feyria’s hidden stores on the V-Plane, along with some scavenged equipment on the ancient ship itself, they came up with the idea of detonating the ship to damage it enough to not leave the planet.
“We do not have much in terms of demolitions, but it should not take much.  Ships are designed to be shielded from the outside, so explosives on the inside are not normally planned for.  Regardless,” he pointed down at the time in the massive walkway, “I can’t imagine these power converter you are talking about are very usable if blown apart.”
There were some minor protests but when it was ultimately silenced by him admitting he might not live long anyway and wouldn’t mind ensuring the ship was destroyed, not much more could be said.  The surprising part came when Feyria insisted she stay behind, which burned Kalco’s ego.
“We will set these on delayed charges, and blow a few up.  All we have to do is damage the ship, it’s not like we need to vaporize it.  The two of us hang out in the tunnel out of the cold and wait for you to come back…you’ll come back right?”  At the time Zaier smirked at them.  Madigan was tempted to say ‘no.’
“I misjudged Zaier,” Kalco said, his tone far more serious than the usual prankster style he had.
Madigan looked over at him for a moment, then back forward; the anomaly on the sensor was steady and they would easily find it.  Whatever ‘it’ was.
“I can’t stand either of them, so didn’t fucking matter to me.”
Kalco looked over at the angry man.  “I bet you get along with Solide.”
“I do, actually.  We have an understanding of sorts about the ineptitude around us.”
“Despite your hate, you seem like a pretty up and up guy so I will tell you that there are things at play here far beyond what we are even seeing.  People like Solide and Zaier confirm it.”
Madigan reached back, scratching a spot on his shoulder that had been cramped against the seat for a while.  “Why?”  Railine was always going on and on about ‘things far beyond our understanding’.  He didn’t mind Railine as he enjoyed the spectacle, but the last thing he wanted was someone else proselytizing him.
“Solide has spec ops written all over his face, and not the smart, subtle agent kind either, but the crude, kill-them-all kind.”
“Let me guess, you’ve seen the type?” Madigan asked.  There was a tension between these two, not out and out dislike, but a subtlety that neither of them could actively be friends with the other.  There was no overt reason exactly beyond simply calling it a ‘tension’ that both felt but neither could pinpoint beyond their occasional light jabs.
“More than I would like.  So the fact he is here suggests to me that someone somewhere thought something was going to go down here.”
Madigan didn’t like someone guessing on such massive amounts of unknowns.  “That’s a lot of speculation…”
“Zaier helps round the theory out.  I am not sure what the fuck his little game was about saying my story was a lie, but he played a bit too much of his hand there; he radiates the same shit.  Can’t pin it down exactly if he was a Classed or not, almost feels like a re-spec, definitely not from birth like most of us are.”
Madigan’s eyes looked over the fact that a gauge charting gravity readings was showing a non-linearity, changing subtly as they got closer.  Not much to do other than remain tight on the controls.  “What does any of that matter?” he asked.
“You’re supposed to be smart.  Means all of this was a set up on some level.  I already admitted I had some deep ties.  Perhaps I ran my mouth a bit too openly, given sleeper agents are apparently all over the fucking place.”
“Yeah…”  Madigan actually sympathized.  “I feel way out of the loop, too.  I just want to get back to fucking space, running my own ship, and not have to deal with this god damn intrigue and betrayal.”
“Despite me not particularly liking you, I trust you anyway,” Kalco said.
“I can’t say the same.”
“I didn’t expect you to.”  Kalco laughed good naturedly.  “That’s why I trust you.”
In front of them a large mountain rose far above the others.  Its tall peaks scraped at the upper levels of the sky, as a wild wind whipped around the sheer sides.  The top was likely conventionally un-scalable given its raw steepness and length.  A peak forever out of reach of Solarians.  In front of them a large maw of a beckoning cave loomed almost big enough that an airborne vehicle could go in at least partly given the unknown depths.  Massive stalactites or perhaps icicles hung from the roof.
“Welcome to our sensor anomaly,” Madigan said while pulling the V-Plane parallel so they would have very little walking distance to the cave.
“Are you scared?”  Kalco said it, but it was unclear if that was a bait or serious.
“Why the fuck are you asking that?”
“You aren’t a soldier, and here we are, the two of us going into an unknown situation, with most of our base missing…”
“I know what the fuck has happened,” Madigan cut him off.  “Of course I am fucking scared, no one knows what that thing was on that ship, and we are all likely just going to die.  The only reason I am doing any of this shit is because on some deep level I don’t expect to make it out unless we get lucky.”
Kalco had a small grin on, “you know, I could easily have made fun of you for being ‘scared’, but that is a brave admission of reality.  I respect that actually.”
They stood silently a few moments.  Madigan turned away, pulling over his head cover and adjusting his face piece as he slammed the button opening the door.  Kalco thought the conversation had gone silent but Madigan added a heartfelt admission, “An old dream keeps me going, I don’t… I can’t give up on it.”
“To be a starship captain.”
Madigan looked at him through his face wraps, surprised he knew.  He wondered if the elite soldier would criticize the dream.
Kalco continued, “I actually listen.”  He paused a moment, “I hope you make it.”
The two of them headed out into the endless wind.
There was an uphill of snow they were walking towards, with Madigan in the lead.  As he was walking, suddenly he fell way down through the snow.  “Fuck!” he yelled as he continued sinking.
Kalco dashed forward to try to grab him, but was far too slow.  “Madigan!”  He disappeared completely from view.  “Madigan!”  Kalco thought in that one moment Madigan would be gone forever down a hidden cliff.
From far below Madigan’s voice came up, “Shit…  I’m okay.  Just a huge snow drift.”  A few moments later from the high hill Kalco was on, the soldier saw Madigan far below him on the floor of the cave.  Carefully following, he sledded down the multi-story wind drift to the bottom.  The cave had a soft, but scary howl far above them.
Neither said anything about the fact that both of them had their weapons out and ready.  Kalco’s had no external signs, but lights pulsed on Madigan’s indicating it was ready to unload energetic death.
Madigan didn’t care what happened to those he left behind, but from a psychological point of view was interested about something and put it straight to his comrade.  “I know you are fucking Feyria.”  He let it hang a second longer to let it sting.  “So why did you let her stay behind?
“She’s a big girl,” Kalco said glibly.
Madigan darkly suspected if she turned up dead it would nicely tie up any loose ends from the guys involved with her.
“Well, I sure hope they blow that shit up,” Madigan said.  “Aelisha tech and history is pretty controlled if someone tries to really dig deep into it.  But those old ships, like the originals…” he was searching for the right words, “it’s tough to explain to someone who doesn’t get engineering, but there was a jump in some of those really old ships…followed by what could be called more like a dive in the tech on those following them.  To clarify, some of the first Aelisha ships were far and away better than many generations of ships after.  Very curious.”
Kalco listened intently to something Madigan shouldn’t know about.  
The cave rapidly funneled down to a large ramp that headed down.  The howling was gratefully left behind them, and Madigan noticed that his breaths didn’t steam.  Pretty soon it was warm enough to take off his hood.  “Let’s call those old ships Gen One.  There are actually a few around still as you know, then next came Gen Two, then Three…”
“Wow…you can count.”
“Listen, asshole, Gen Two and Three, arguably even Four were WORSE than One.  There aren’t even Twos or Threes that still are in service.  Why do you think that is?”
Kalco looked at him and sighed.  What he was about to tell him was something that was off the cuff and could easily be dismissed, but it held a truth that would be very, very dangerous if taken seriously or ever got out.  “The Aelisha didn’t build those.”
Madigan stopped dead.  “What?”
Kalco shrugged.  “We think we know a lot, but those Gen One aren’t of Aelisha construction.  Not all of it anyway.  The power core that powers them were salvaged from some ancient wrecks and that’s why there are only a few of those ships ever made.”
“How the hell do you know that?”  It was ridiculous that a solider like Kalco would know anything about that at all.  “No way that is the truth, how the fuck would you know that?”
“A fox never lies.”  Kalco put his hands on his head simulating Aelisha ears.
“What the fuck does that even mean?  Aelisha lie all the time.”  The two had not taken a step for a while now.
“It means we keep walking.”
“I didn’t want to stop until you started making up stories about everything.”  Madigan shook his head and marched off alone.  They had walked down for a while as it continued getting warmer.  There were drips of water coming from the ceiling of the cave around them and a soft green light was visible further down.
Kalco ran up, slapping him playfully on the back and started laughing.  “I don’t like you, but in a lot of ways I am gaining a begrudging respect for you.”
“…”  Madigan took a long pause before saying, “You helped save us against that Death Angel…so thanks.”
“Hey look, it’s like we’re best buds now!”
“I still think you are an arrogant asshole.”
“Now now, buddy.”
The ramp now took a very artificial right turn; it was bright enough they no longer needed their suit lights at all.
They both turned at approximately the same time.  They were about to say something about how artificial the whole tunnel was, but what they saw didn’t need to be stated in the least anymore.
“Holy shit…”
“I think we found your anomaly, Madigan.”
In front of them, bathed in a light like a soft midday sun, was what looked like it could be a small alien city.  There were pillars, pylons, obelisks, and varied structures that at once looked familiar but wholly alien at the same time.  The structures were surrounded by a massive wall protecting everything on the inside and only the tops of them were visible from their slightly elevated position.
It could perhaps be described as an alien city, but that didn’t feel right as it was clear nothing lived here.  It was a construction of a foreign mind for reasons unfathomable.  To these two men arguing about stupid things, they could never hope to understand its purpose.
It was on an uncanny construction such that two slanted pylons would join at nearly right-angles but noticeably off enough that it came off as disturbing instead of inaccurate.  From this so-close-but-so-far angular travesty others rods or towers would erect off.  It was far from random, but the shapes looked so foreign as to only disturb the mind of those looking at it.  Made with such deliberateness, perhaps it was the viewer who was mistaken about what was wrong.  
“You know what you said earlier?” Kalco asked him.  He twirled his pistol nervously in his hand.
“I said a lot.”
“About being scared.”
“Yeah?” Madigan asked.
Kalco looked right at him, confident despite the waver in his voice.  “I’m finally getting scared about this too.  Naturally.”
 
Ryla
Day-2, Morning
Location: Reiko-10, Medical Lab

Ryla’s misjudgment of Railine confused her as she was normally a good judge of character and to have him act the way he had was puzzling.  Something was clearly wrong in that situation, but to resort to violence and start threatening them was not something she could abide by at all.  She was not going to make excuses for his conduct.  There were bigger things at play here that Ryla could loosely guess at and would not be burdened by someone unstable or antagonistic.
The base was big, but it ultimately felt not that large when there was the ever-present threat of the creatures, Solide, and now the duo of Railine and Aria.  Any of them were more than capable of killing Ryla and some had clear hostile intentions.  Her destiny was fastened to Laina, a capable woman, but it left Ryla worried that only one person stood between her and the crazies.
She trusted both of Laina and Aria, yet when faced with the decision…she closed her eyes, not wanting to second guess herself.
How had this all happened so fast?  Her head swam from the lack of sleep and stress catching up with her.  What was it, two planet cycles ago or so, right?  Yeah, that was right, it had already been two planetary cycles since she had come off that night shift following all the strange communications with Reiko-7.  At the time, Zaier had not wanted to let the others know about how bad what was occurring at the other base had been, if any of the messages were to be trusted.  He knew how odd they were, which is why they mounted the expedition that very morning.  For Ryla, this had meant next to zero sleep and was starting to feel its effects.
The records of the panicked communication that Zaier did not want to release made sense now in retrospect with all the talk over at Reiko-7 about watching who to trust, figures, bodies, and murders.  It was scary and impossible to piece together what was actually occurring, or how bad it might truly be; yet knowing how things had come to pass every cryptic line now made sense.  They were portending, if she had only known then that those paranoid messages were based on something very real.
In a lot of ways Ryla had failed here as well.  This was a redemption assignment from her past, and her skills had made someone, somewhere, think she had potential vast potential in a precocious way.  For the role she played, it was brilliant for the cover it provided; yet it did truly gnaw at her subconscious as her desire to avoid violence was true at her root.  At some level, the persona Ryla adopted and her true self had mixed in a blur that was tough to separate when she dared to self-reflect.
In her past, her mistake was because she did not talk enough.  She let hatred, paranoia, and personal bias get in the way of everything.  The failure to communicate had cost people their lives, to say it bluntly, and the blood was truly on her hands.  So her regrets of this current situation stung more than perhaps it would have to others.  Her thoughts circled around that had likely need only to have spoken up and she could have avoided the rift with Railine and Aria, or maybe convinced Zaier to not go on what may have been a suicide mission with the likely traitor Madigan.
The situation was far different, but at its root was no different than the mistake of her past.  Assumptions had got people killed.
‘No…’ Ryla thought, ‘Assumptions DID get people killed.  But it was me who killed them.’
She had not sworn off weapons back then, as it was something she later had adopted in a futile attempt at redemption for her mistake.  Now, it certainly seemed like a mistake at this point, in two senses.  She eventually realized the past could not ever be redeemed, it was forever unchanged; and now perhaps more importantly, she was not skilled in weapons at a time they might be the only hope she had.
Ryle was hopeless in a situation that had little hope to begin with.  She pulled out the knife Railine gave her, looking at it, as hard as it was for her.  Could she really use a weapon in anger again?  Ryla was driven by a conviction that even ‘violent’ encounters could be ended without violence on the other’s part.  She knew the ultimate mission she was charged with, but that did not change her conviction it could be done her way.  Her race would laugh at her, trading their pragmatic reality for her idealism the universe did not support.
The reverie she was engaged in was halted when she heard the sound of rending metal coming from outside.  Curious, she ran to the window and saw the Lift-Bike with Solide flying into the hangar.  The doors of the hangar opened, but from this window she could not see clearly.  She left, running down a room to get a better view.  By the time she got to the next window, the dark events were already complete.
From here she could hear the sound of gunfire in the hangar, and though she could not see Solide, the Gyro-Copter’s front was clearly damaged.  Damaged so much it could not fly right now, that was for certain; in fact it may never fly again no matter how skilled the repair.  Gunfire continued erupting.  Bright lights would light up the inside of the hangar, and parts of the wall on the outside would be blown apart.  
Her heart continued to sink with this heavy implication: now there were no air vehicles remaining on Reiko-10.  She was wondering what was happening over there when she heard someone behind her.
Laina had come over, “Well, looks like we are trapped.”
Ryla turned to look at the medic, who was now smiling strangely at her.  Ryla did a double take seeing what looked like dark lines through her pupil-less eyes, face, and down her neck.  Ryla had a gloomy feeling deep in her heart.
“Laina…your face?”
“Oh?”  Her eyes flashed a moment, regaining their pupils, and the dark lines faded away before coming back in a quick pulse.  “Axl Lines are surprisingly hard to hide.”  The black lines looked like canals of sorts as they were slightly recessed into her face and neck.  As evidence for her statement there was a slight energy that appeared to be arcing through them, almost holographic-like at the edge of what was visible to the eye.
“…What?”
Laina took a step towards Ryla who reactively stepped backwards.
“You are dangerous.  Extremely so.  You also chose wrong, so how fortuitous for me.  You are an enemy of many.”  Ryla sensed something deeply wrong here.  “Do you realize out of all the players here, all of them hate you and your kind?  If they knew the truth, no one would not tolerate your incessant meddling at all.”
“What is going on?   What is on your face?”
Laina traced one of the angular shapes that looked etched on her throat and cheek, moving all the way up to her eye where even the pupil had changed colors.  “When you channel either of the two types of Axls in higher enough doses, this is the effect.”  Her fingers lingered over some of the geometric lines on her face with a sense of longing.  “These are conduits for a sort of energy so it is only natural we would show a type of scarring or scar tissue.  I am surprised you are not showing any, quite frankly.”  Laina’s eyes narrowed, “Evidently you have a strong affinity for Axls, I can feel that clearly, but it’s not clear what you are…”
The word ‘Axl’ triggered more than could easily be expressed in Ryla’s mind, but she had such practice not showing her true thoughts she played along flawlessly.  The cover she had adopted so long ago had spilled into who she was.  “I don’t understand.  Don’t we need to try to get a hold of the others?  Or find Railine?”  Ryla was a bit too much into character and was having a hard time dropping it despite the clarity something serious was happening.  For so long she had played dumb as a natural reflex it was hard to drop.
Laina looked slightly confused, ironically faltering a little herself at Ryla’s reflexive stupidity.  “Not at all.  Railine is dead.  Everything has worked out perfectly so far.  Two of the largest threats were killed nearly without hassle.”  She blinked slowly, and despite her face structure still exactly the same, the changed eyes and black markings made her look far darker and focused.  “I can’t tell if you are feigning ignorance, or you aren’t Awake yet.  Or perhaps I am simply wrong about my read on what you are?”  Laina acted jovial for a moment, waving one hand in a laconic excitement, “Regardless, I sense a power in you that clearly needed to be stopped.  Wow…I really am lucky to be able to stop you before any of that came to fruition!”  Her voice was excited, but to Ryla it was not a statement to be happy about.
Two threats were dead?  One was Rox, so was the other on the plane with the other team?  Laina was with Ryla this whole time, so how did she know anything about might have transpired with Railine?
“Who do you mean?”
“You and Rox.  Both of you were vastly different but key players in a way that were so luckily disposed of.  Rox, killed by her own allies, and you were left alone before your potential could be realized.  The Fate Line’s on this are nearly complete.  A few loose ends and this one may lock rather than fracture backwards.  Outstanding.”
Ryla was still very confused, but it didn’t long matter.  How did she know about Fate Lines?
Laina took two fast steps at Ryla who instinctually dodged to the side in a way almost no one would have been able to.  Ryla’s speed was unbelievable.
“See?  Somewhere in you, there is this power that is fearsome, I am so grateful it never came to fruition.  Honestly I think you have been playing dumb this whole time, so let’s see!”  Laina charged at her, slashing with her hand, and in an impressive dance between the two, Ryla hovered outside of the attack.
Ryla had tears streaming down her face.  “What are you doing, what is happening!?”  Ryla was confused on so many levels, including the way her body was forced to reflexively dodge Laina who had a speed she should not have.  The front she had put on for so long was crumbling, but not nearly at a fast enough rate.  Ryla had been trained for many things, and even briefed on the highest of her enemies, but to be facing down a likely one was something the young Ryla was not truly ready for.
Laina stopped, laughing a sad laugh.  “I cannot tell the full truth of what you may be, but is there any doubt watching this charade of your ignorance right now?  Are you only playing stupid, or have the necessary triggers not yet been activated?”  The question was rhetorical, as Ryla overtly did not know what she was talking about.  “Your type sickens me.  Embracing such levels of pain as ‘normal’, taunting those in existence with a reward of hope at the edge of realization…at an end of salvation…” Laina shook her head with contempt so deep it furrowed her face.  “You strive for an ideal based on lies.  Leading trillions to death on the hope something could change.  Disgusting.  DISGUSTING!”  She slashed her hand to the side violently, and pink energy shot off as it rended the metal on the floor upwards.
“Laina, please tell me what is going on!  What are you!?  We don’t need to fight!”
Laina started laughing.  “This microcosm we represent is really fun.  How scary it would be if you knew anything about what was happening and could actually use your power.  I might be in actual danger, that is quite clear.”  She stopped for a moment, tapping her nose in thought.  “Your actions confused me.  Maybe I have you and Rox backwards?  Was she from that servile race and you are the divine one that hasn’t fully manifested yet?  Well…that could be interesting!  Though that might be a reward in a way.  I understand how important it is to stop this insane wish your ilk espouses.  This is goodbye.”
 The next instant Laina looked like she had teleported right next to Ryla, and her right arm shoved her fist straight through Ryla’s stomach, literally blowing a hole through her.  Not even Ryla’s skill was enough to stop Laina’s true power.
Ryla looked down, her mouth open, gapping and stuttering.  In her body cords were lashing out, trying to string a lattice of biologic tissue back together to save her from the deadly hit.
“My, my, still standing?”  Laina shook her head.  “This really confirms every word I have stated, though I guess you were not the divine one.  Such a strange being; such a strange race, so very powerful for the base dimension…”
Laina reeled back and struck again, this time at Ryla’s heart with a similar piercing attack.  Within the cavity, a short pulse of cold energy electrically shot through Ryla, dropping her to the floor in an instant.
In that moment as Ryla was bleeding out from the strange attack, dying and regretting so much of her life.  She thought of two recent decisions she could have made to avoid this, both when Railine offered for her to go with them, and originally when Solide had asked her to come after just killing the kind Rox.
She had chosen wrong.  But how could she have known?  The Emotion Field was so empty, and her Psionics were hardly triggering…she could not have known…could not have known…
Ryla cranked her head to the side, looking up at the woman who was supposed to be a healer, and could have easily saved her from something like this.  Laina’s wild hair hung around her cold, dark-line etched face as she stared at Ryla dying at her feet.  Saying nothing, Laina watched with either a sick pleasure or a detached ambivalence, but Ryla could not truly tell from this angle.  It didn’t really matter.  Ryla died with the unfortunate final thoughts being a jumbled mix of hatred and regret clinging to her young wounded heart.


 
Kalco
Day-2 Morning
Location: Sensor Anomaly

If this set of ruins could be called a city, this was the border wall they were at.  A simple flat metal piece swept away from them on both sides, disappearing far down the aqua illumination this huge cave structure held.  The gate in the wall did not look ornate, nor really have any notable feature at all other than the featureless wall on both sides.  It merely ended abruptly in a size big enough to drive a small vehicle through.
“I got a bad feeling about this…” Madigan said.
“You believe in that kind of stuff?”  Kalco did not let it show that he did.
“I used to not.  Gave Railine a hard time for stupid shit like that, but…”  Madigan lifted his head at the towering angular structures on the inside.  He lifted his hands to his mouth and called, “Hey!”  The sound came back with a dead muffle.
“We play it safe.  Stay by each other, weapons ready.  We see anything we don’t like, and we evac.  I’m not sure any answer we want is here.”
Madigan looked away from him to hide his face, taking a deep breath, letting it out.  “No, we are here for a reason.”
‘Here for a reason’ sounded ominous, was that how he meant it?  Both Madigan’s words, and Kalco’s read on him suggested he did not believe in anything spiritual so the statement was odd.  He would try baiting him for the answer.
“Hard to believe something like this was here, though maybe this is exactly why Reiko was colonized.”
Madigan turned back, his face confident with this answer, if nothing else.  “No, we only started getting strange readings after we lost contact with the other bases, and the whole Reiko-7 incident.”
“Destiny does weird things.  Maybe your friend might be smarter than you give him credit for.”
“Don’t give me that shit.  You believe some voodoo shit too?”
Kalco lifted a palm up in a shrug.  “The longer I live the more things seem to happen for a reason…Kidding!”
“I can never tell when you are serious, pisses me off.”  Madigan pointed up in the sky.  “Do you see things at the edge of your vision?  It looks like movement, or a body flying, but I look and it’s nothing.  Like some fucking ghost city.”
“No,” Kalco said, looking at Madigan like he was crazy.  Madigan looked confused or disappointed.  “Ha!  Just joking.”
Madigan’s face turned angry, “Stop fucking around!”
“I’m doing it to relieve tension.”  Kalco was serious now, pointing into the air with his pistol, ‘Aelishun’.  “I see it too, some visual distortion is happening here.  Maybe it is doing something to our optical nanites.”  Kalco did not let on how disturbing it was that he too would see what could only be called figures manifest at the edge of his vision.
“Well, let’s do…”  Madigan was saying as the two men with a growing respect for each other nodded and took a couple of steps over the threshold.
The sentence was never completed because as soon as Kalco passed over it, he felt dizzy and fell to his knees.  His world was spinning as the scene around him went white.  He forcible lifted his head and was on a flat plane where the ground was a cloudy white, and the sky was meaningless in color.  The city that had been in front of him was gone.
KALCOKALCOKALCO
Ugh…  He put a hand on his head, trying to block out the loud voice.
He stood up, in enough of a mental state to know he was under some sort of hallucination.  
‘Okay, take a few steps back, and I’ll be right back outside.’  It was simple enough in theory.
He carefully backed up, one, two, then multiple steps.  Soon he was running backwards, wondering why he hadn’t backed up out of this illusion.
HAHAHAHAHAHA
Each ‘Ha’ pounded into his head like a bullet.
“Madigan!” he yelled, but the sound faded rapidly.  “Madigan!”
ARE YOU WORTHY OF LIFE?
Kalco spun around, looking for a source of the voice, but he was only in white.  Looking down at his hand, he saw it was indeed in color.  He was the only thing in this colorless, featureless world.
ARE YOU WORTHY OF LIFE?  The harsh voice asked him again.
“Naturally!” he yelled back proudly.
HAHAHA, each one like a punch to him.  WILL YOU PROVE YOUR WORTH?
What the hell was this?  Kalco ran a bit, pretty sure he was moving, but was worried why there was even a doubt about that simple fact.  “I am not going to prove anything to you.”
THEN YOU WILL DIE.
His arms and legs opened up in lacerations, and in a dramatic flair spurts of blood splashed out like a fountain as it sent him to the floor.  “GAHHH!”  He rolled in a pain a few times.  His nanites among other things kicked in and faster than would seem normal for a Solarian, the wounds had stopped bleeding.  It defied medicine but it was as if the injury was a one-time pain, without lasting effect.
He sat up, looking at his arms, ripping a glove off to look at his hand and wrist.  His suit was not cut at all, yet there was certainly blood pooled around him.  Even his exposed hand had blood dripping down them, yet when he lifted his jacket up his arm the wounds had been sealed as quick as they had opened up.  This did not stop the pain however.
SO YOU POSSESS AT LEAST SOME VITALITY TO YOU.
“What the hell is going on!?”
WILL YOU LISTEN?
“Yes!”
The next moment Kalco felt like a strong gust of wind hit him so hard he was knocked over.  He closed his eyes, and that was a mistake as images rapidly flooded his brain.  Static like old electronics was all he could see and hear.  Sound rose louder and louder, and he was sure he would go deaf.  The static coalesced into a visual of a sine wave oscillating as it flattened out from his point of view into a black void into which he fell.  There was darkness all around him.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
He did not understand anything; this was making him lose his grip on reality more than anything.
“I’m Kalco…I’m a soldier,” he repeated to himself; it helped ignore at least a little of what was going on around him.  “I’m Kalco…”
The next instant he was tumbling through the air and landed on a sand dune with a hot sun overhead.  All around him were endless dunes and a clear sky.  He was over-heating very quickly, and tried to undo his jacket, but it would not come off.  He reached for his knife and it was not there.  In a panic he looked around and saw what looked like the stereotypical oasis in the distance, sure he had not seen in the first time but no longer cared.  Sweat was pouring off his face as he charged down the dune, taking a fall as he spun head over heels, smashing into the bottom and coughing out sand.  Fuck…so hot…  He got up and put one foot in front of the other, determined at all costs to make it to that water.  If it was one thing Kalco had, it was determination.
He charged on and on, hitting the cooler shade before falling into the water.
INTERESTING.  ARE YOU THE ONE WE HAVE WAITED FOR?
As soon as he hit the water, the whole scene began to fade away.  A string of voices came from behind him.  He turned, and the mere act of turning had completely dropped the desert and the heat away, and now he was in a black void with very strong and focused Solarians and Aelishas standing around him.  Their accusations began ripping into him.
“You are a liar.”
“You have used everyone that ever meant anything to you.”
“You let me die.”
“You let us all die.”
“Have you ever not been fundamentally deceitful?” an attractive Aelisha asked him.
“A fox never lies.”  A male Aelisha held his hands up to his ears, mimicking something Kalco had said earlier; it was not necessary however, since he actually possessed the long, straight ears that Kalco was referring to. 
He yelled back to them all, “I am a hero!”
“Hero?  Hahahaha!”  They all started laughing in unison.  The laughs pounded his head; where had he heard that laugh before?
“All you have ever done is run.  Run and sacrifice everything so that you may continue.”
“Deny it!” another Solarian man yelled.
“You are nothing.”
“A coward!”
“You knew on a deep level that something was wrong.”  He looked at a young girl, Elyria.  “You did not trust your instincts with me.”
“No…” he whispered.  “I wanted to trust you.”
She looked innocent, a barefooted girl that belied the lives she cost.  “You betrayed the instincts that had saved you.”
“I was supposed to save you!”  Kalco yelled back to her.
More men around him spoke, almost in unison, “Yet more lives were lost because of you, the venerated ‘Sole Survivor’.”
He knew all these faces, and on a deep subconscious level had long erased most of them.  Their accusations stung in a way he could not defend.
“I…” he stammered.  His grip on what he was, who he was, was slipping.  He may not have been as good as he thought he was.
“KALCO!”
“KALCOKALCO!”  Their jeers all merged together.
The proud soldier’s eyes were watering as he held his head in his hands.
DISAPPOINTING.  YOU HAVE MUCH TO LEARN
The next instant the jeering was replaced by the white again and his arms and legs once again exploded out with even more violent force, the splatters of blood covering the completely white floor.
“AGHHHHH!”  He rolled back and forth, holding his arms together.  “God no!  Stop….rahhhggg!”
HAHAHAHAHA SO BASIC SO PATHETIC.
Some latent instinct of a hardened soldier came to him.  He reached for his pocket where his ReNew Pak was, but felt nothing.  He imagined with all his heart that it was truly there and this was all a dream, grabbing it and injecting it into his leg.  Nothing.
Nothing.
INTERESTING SPIRIT.  YOU ARE NOT A COMPLETE FAILURE.  YET YOU ARE FAR FROM READY.  LET US CONTINUE.
Kalco, with every fiber of will, forced himself up and began to run.  It was all white everywhere.  In a more rational frame of mind he might have reasoned that if he was not actually temporally or spatially transported, he should still be in these alien ruins.  But now he was just a panicked animal.
Running, clawing, screaming, he ran and ran at the white, wanting out more strongly than anything in the world.


 
Aria
Day-2, Dusk 
Location: Reiko-10, Delta Wing

Aria had been laying low for most of this planet’s cycle, but her path was becoming clear to her.  Aria’s fate now rested with a man she shared a past with but he did not know it.  The raw calculated odds seemed remote, and she wanted to consider if what he possessed was a copy or the real one that stirred her heart so badly.  Back only a couple of cycles ago when things were normal she did all she could to confirm that the necklace he wore was not…hers…but as much as could be discerned, it sure seemed definitive.
She owed her current survival to that Aria was inconspicuous, if nothing else.  She had a way of blending in with the shadows even when standing.  It left her with a ‘creepy’ vibe to those who didn’t know her better.  It this case though it was useful; it was keeping her alive as the base was being overran.  
She’d take an occasional shot at these figures, blowing them away with her accurate shots from her very powerful rifle.  Strangely though it seemed a variation on center-of-mass shots seemed to be more effective than headshots.  After taking her shot, she would retreat to a new location lest the Death Angel that had killed her close friend Railine find her.
Her mission was to get out of here.  There was no way there was any hope in staying here.  She sealed her fate choosing to go with Railine and would not go back to Laina and Ryla – one who could not fight in the slightest and the other was a selfish liar.  Regardless of that, quite frankly that pair would get mowed over by that creature; Railine was tougher and a better fighter than those two could ever hope to be.
From her hiding spot she saw a few creatures slashing away at a wall.  Curiously they seemed intelligent enough to be directed in their actions of destroying the base.  She was preparing a shot when she heard a few blasts of a gun down a wing and they all turned and ran towards it with surprising alacrity.  She stood still for a while to make sure nothing was behind her and went after the sound.  Laina did not use firearms so it left only two other options.
As she maneuvered closer, a body came falling out, half of its torso blown away.  Creeping in she saw it was Solide holding his own against a group of them.  He was geared out in much more advanced power armor, holding a combat shield in one hand and his weapon ‘Claim Jumper’ in the other.  
She watched as he backhanded one of the creatures with the shield, the impact amplified by the armor as it flew into the back wall, its body breaking from impact.  The hit would be more than enough to break Solarian bones – AGEd and all – and thankfully seemed to be effective against these monsters as well.  In one fluid movement of dropping the first creature, he spun, pulling the trigger on another group.  
“Hahaha!  Come on, you fuckers!  This isn’t my first time with you, where’s the big one!?  Where’s the fucking Death Angel!?”  His shotgun rang out as bodies exploded around the room.  Quickly, the group besieging him had run out of bodies.  He laughed more to himself, stomping one of its sad, vacant faces under his armored boot.  He pulled the trigger on another dead body as flesh exploded over the back wall.
Solide was doing a good thing, but it was quite obvious to Aria that talking to him was not a good move.  Maybe she would leave him in his psycho state to protect the base for a while.  She slowly started leaving to go to the vehicle bay when the Death Angle appeared behind Solide.
“Fucker!” Solide screamed, pulling the trigger at it with an alarming speed of an experienced killer.  His weapon was capable of blowing away a group of very dangerous enemies, but to this thing it was only partially effective if that.  Despite the rounds hitting it, its soft face looked at Solide with pity in its eyes, which looked so close to Solarian as to be recognizable but far enough away to be very disturbing and scary.
The Death Angel unfolded her hand as fragments of crystal not unlike its ‘wings’ shot out at him.  He dodged and rolled away, but when he got up to move and his leg was dragging.
“No fucking way, no fucking way,” he muttered.
From here Aria could see one of those glass panes sticking through part of the armor, and perhaps part of his leg.  The power armor servo was severed, if not his own biologic connections.  He bent down to try to do something, and he would very quickly die without her assistance.
Aria lined up a shot at the creature’s head, pulling the trigger as the hyper sonic round exploded out and went straight through what should have been the face.  The creature’s beautiful face recoiled like everything should have, only it lowered back down without the commiserate hole through it.  Aria’s heart dropped.  She revealed her position to save the idiot Solide and now they both were going to die.
From the corner of her eye she saw a small object was tossed from Solide, and it landed near the creature before engulfing it in flames.
“Keep firing!” Solide yelled, one handing his shotgun at the flames and the extreme recoil hardly being seen with the suit’s strength.
Aria reciprocated by launching round after round into the creature, both unloading an incredible amount of firepower at this thing.  Without warning there was a terrible screech that she felt far more than she heard, the creature vaporizing into red tinsel or glitter as it rained down, nearly touching the ground before disappearing.  In some strange way Aria felt a surge of energy in a way she never had before.  Despite the firepower the two heavily armed soldiers had, they had barely won, Aria wondered how much of their victory was due to previous damage done by Railine’s sacrifice.
“Holy fuck…”  Solide finished ripping off the shin of the power armor, tossing it to the side before he came hobbling over.  “Do you know how many men I lost last time killing one of those fucks?  This thing was weaker.  Someone had to have fought it before us.”  Aria thanked Railine in her heart.
Aria stepped back to maintain distance.  “Is it dead?”
“Hell if I know if they are even alive, but yeah, as far as we can tell it’s gone.”  Solide looked at Aria as if it was the first time he realized who had helped him.  “You?  Ha…”  He shook his head ‘no’.  “Wow what a joke you’re still alive.  ‘Oh I’m Classed’ you’re telling yourself.  Do you think that fucking matters?”  Aria was surprised that Solide knew she was Classed; what about herself indicated that?  She had told Railine in their previous conversations but that was unlikely to have gotten to Solide.  “Do you think it fucking matters!?”
Regardless, Aria was used to people yelling at her and said nothing.
He put a hand to his face, the exoskeleton glove on the outside nearly dwarfing his whole head.  “I don’t know how I make it out of this one.  Everything is so wrong.  Everything!”  He took a step forward, she stepped back.
“Stop.”
“You don’t get it…  I had a talk with Rox…she is still alive!  That crazy bitch is still alive!”
Aria knew at this point he was crazy.  “No, what chance Rox had…was not taken.”  A euphemism for the fact Rox’s medical saviors let her die in various ways.  Aria felt partially bad but knew her own personality enough that she would not be able to overpower a stronger persona like Laina, especially when it was regarding a medical issue.  Perhaps Railine should have spoken up, and maybe Aria would have come to the defense then.  But really this was still all just speculation that Rox could have lived with part of her head blown off.
“That’s what I thought too!”  He balled up a fist and tapped it to his forehead a couple of times.  “It’s the fucking Elyria Modality all over again…How about you, what surprises you have for me, little girl!?  I think I might be the only Solarian here!  That crazy bitch tried to shoot me!  Not that I blame her, after I shed a little light on her mind…if you know what I fucking mean!”  He started laughing hysterically again.  He took a stagger step again towards her.  “Makes me wonder, how I can shoot someone, yet they come back to haunt me?  What kind of secrets do you have, you little bitch!?”
Aria needed to get out of here, and a way with words was not her strength so she simply turned and ran.
His shouts followed after her.  “I’ve killed a lot of people, and this isn’t the first time one of those little bitches comes back!”
From the Alpha wing a dark wave of smoke was coming out: a fire further down the hall somewhere.  At this point it didn’t matter, she had to leave.  She got to the vehicle bay and saw only one vehicle left, fortunately it was one she was quite familiar with.  She grabbed the Armored Personal Carrier and jumped in, and with trained practice slammed the throttle forward, the damaged doors to the base automatically creaking open as she got close before she tore off into the snow.  The light of the day was leaving quickly.  The soft snow blowing in the darkness added an ominous feel to the approaching night.
At this point it was pure luck anymore as things were falling apart rapidly.  Before they left, the others had mentioned a few locations with strange energy signs; they might be at any one.  Further, Aria was mostly careful in keeping her thoughts focused, but an unresolved emotional issue was slowly making its way to the forefront that could not be contained.  She wanted a man in her past to prove a truth she desperately wanted to believe but had taken ever since as a lie.  A simple necklace almost taunting her with its emotional loading on it.
Even if this issue was resolved…would it matter with almost certain death on this icy planet?
Maybe it was the certainty of death that made emotional things like this so important to resolve.
The base behind her was in flames on one section of it, with a bleeding, homicidal man rampaging with a shotgun.  She knew the odds of her living were low, but it had given her a freedom to act.  She now had to know; it was something she had repressed for so long until the unlikeliest of assignments had the two of them back together.
She held her powerful rifle ‘Broken Promise’ to her side like a young girl might hold a stuffed animal for comfort.  She had to know, even if it meant her death as she had become resigned to that likelihood.
Was his promise sincere all this time and she had simply assumed he would not remember?  If he had lived, and remembered their love, why did he not come find her?  No way he would have remained loyal so long…yet…he still had her necklace.
She felt something in her eye.  She put her gloved hand up and wiped, pulling away to see moisture on her fingertips.  That confused her.  That does not normally happen.

 
Kalco
Day-2 Night 
Location: Dirt pile, Sensor Anomaly

A beeping on a small wrist band softly pulsed.  The light from it rose and sank in a soft rhythm, submerged in a pile of dirt.  The beeping had continued for a long time until it stirred the man who was unconscious in the soil.
“Ugh…”  With the shock of awareness Kalco suddenly shot up to a sitting position.  Confused where he was, he remembered only vague things, and noticed he was outside the alien ruins at the bottom of the ramp.  His eyes looked at the strange fact one of his gloves was missing, with dried blood caked onto his hand.  He went to stand up and felt his muscles tear.  With a hurried motion he tore open his jacket to see his arms indeed had the strange injuries on them without any wear or evidence on the outside of his jacket. His head swam from what was a loss of blood.
“Holy shit…gah…”  The motion caused a short burst of pain.  He stopped for a moment, trying to collect his thoughts.  He walked into the ‘city’, something happened to him, and he barely got out.  Oh, he had someone with him.  The pilot…Madigan.  That’s right!
He slowly rose to his feet, swaying for a moment as he stumbled back to the ruins merely to look, not to go into there ever again.  “Madigan!”   Below him was the trail of two sets of footprints.  He was not going to get close to that gate again, but still could not just give up.
He came near enough to see what he needed to see, and what he saw was easy to explain but made zero sense.  The footprints of the two men were obvious right up to the precipice then ended.  Both of them disappeared like that was the end of the line.
‘What the fuck…?’  Kalco bent down, grabbing a few rocks.  It took the second throw to land a rock inside the gate.  The rock unceremoniously landed inside and utterly unchanged like it was the most normal thing ever.  It meant nothing to him though because there was no way he was going in there, regardless of what the inanimate object showed.  “Madigan!”
The beeper on his wrist was going off.  A screen popped up, it was a holographic medical tracker alerting him that he had dangerously low blood levels, and had not moved in an unhealthy amount of time and his nanites were increasing stimulant levels to compensate.
‘Well, what the hell do I do?’ he thought to himself.  Thinking about it, he glanced at the gate, noticing there were not any steps coming out of it either.  Now deeply intrigued, he followed his most recent trail to where he was face down in the dirt.  He of course saw his own footprints after he woke up, but likewise there was no steps leading to this location he had unceremoniously woke up at.  What was happening here was far beyond his comprehension, and all it was so far was mere spatial distortion he was trying to figure out.
The short walk made him pant a bit, and he thought about how much blood he was down.  Pulling up the holographic screen, hit a button to see the time.  If it was to be trusted, almost the whole day had passed.  Damn, he must have been extremely injured if he still felt like shit as his nanites should have healed him.  Maybe Feyria had something stashed on the V-Plane, certainly a Medi-kit to help boost his nanites and heal his body if nothing else.
Wait…his ReNew Pak.  He patted himself, and felt the drop in his stomach of flat nothingness.  He patted a few more locations and nothing.  Now in a minor panic he slapped his sides and both his knife and his pistol were gone; he had nothing on him.  “Oh shit…”  His heart sank further.  No one here understood that pistol and the secret technology it held.  It had saved his ass so many times, and now it was gone, likely in that fucking alien city.  “Madigan!  Hey!”  Only ominous silence came back to him.
It was clear he needed to find what he could on the plane and then decide what to do.  He rushed back to the vehicle, but really felt how busted up he was where even the job up the ramp left him winded.  Stopping two separate times made the experienced soldier feel sick and out of shape.
The darkness coming from the mouth of the cave told him of the approximate time.  Hitting a light on his suit, it luckily worked and lit his way out of the tunnel.  The cold outside was not welcome, especially on his hand.  He looked around, almost cursing that the suit light was not stronger, but he eventually felt a small well of relief that the V-plane was still there in the darkness.  He punched the buttons to open the door and hurried inside.  The lights coming on in the cabin was oddly calming as it seemed so normal amidst the recent events.
He remembered the argument Zaier had with Feyria about her stashing items illicitly on the plane.  It was now an irony that was not lost on him that her stash Kalco had personally made fun of was now badly needed.  Digging through the supplies in the back, there was a small Medi-kit he used on himself with reckless abandon and rapidly felt much better.  He tore the kit apart as he sloshed various parts of the kit over his wounds.
He had slumped against the wall of the plane, truly feeling the fatigue of the last two cycles, and whatever strange thing he endured in that city finally hit him.  He lost consciousness and dozed.
Waking back up, he shook his head a little and resumed his search, this time grabbing a heavy pistol he had dismissed earlier.  There were two larger rifles, but he preferred pistols so much that he would not trade them away unless there was a huge power gap.
Naturally, he recognized ‘Sledgehammer’ model pistols.  They were pretty good, just not Aelishun good.  The large heft felt solid, much like his beloved and lost pistol.  These were potent, large bore weapons that fired rounds that kinetically dumped their energy into the first thing they hit.  The kickback on them was very, very strong and almost always the shooter needed armor on just to handle the recoil.  Their penetration was nearly non-existent, but the stopping power was insane on them literally designed to knock things down.  He remembered having to use one once against a wild Behemon on Psilon 7; stopping its headlong charge cold.
He continued poking through Feyria’s secret stores she had in the back when the plane started powering up.   “Madigan?”  He asked, thinking the pilot had somehow come back with him knowing.
Dashing up front, there was no one in the pilot seat.  ‘What the hell?’
To his side he head the door sealing shut.
“Oh shit…”  He ran to the closing door and had a few moments to decide if he was going to bail out or to ride this ghost ship.  He did not want to leave Madigan behind, but concluded him jumping out here likely doomed both of them to die at the sensor anomaly.  
The choice was not there for long as the door sealed shut and was taking off.  Kalco made his way to the back to the cockpit, looking at various screens and saw one had ‘Grav-Beacon Return Triggered’ displayed.  This relieved him somewhat, as it meant a Solarian was summoning the plane, probably Feyria.
Grav-Beacons…  Madigan talked about them a bit, and Kalco had been around when a few were used.  At its root was the ability to remote pilot vehicles, which meant there was a pilot alive somewhere, triggering this to fly without them actually being there.  They were good for emergencies like extractions or if the pilots were killed as the vehicle could still be ‘flown’ in a conventional sense.
As a vehicle had to be previously slaved to the beacon for it to work, Feyria had again likely acted out of command by tying to two vehicles together at some point in the past.  Once this was done, the Grav-Beacon could trigger simple flight paths, essentially giving basic commands to the AI.  They acted as a loophole in the vehicle’s programming, subtly disturbing its gravic sensors so that it thought ‘home base’ was whatever location was programmed in; causing a ‘return to home’ function to trigger as it would fly back to the right location.
They operated over gravic waves, which was why it could still get the command across the electric disturbance of the planet.  However, they were tightly controlled and in general were looked down upon as it allowed vehicles to be commandeered without any knowledge of who had done it – assuming they were able to establish the first initial connection.  Feyria clearly had a more illicit background or connection than she seemed like.
Regardless, the screen told him nearly everything as it was going back to the only person who had one that he knew of: Feyria.
One of the downsides, was the ‘return home’ function of the AI of ships was a slower than if a pilot or normal flight path was programmed.  The ride was going to be long, so before he got some rest, he went back and poked around more.  He threw boxes to the side as he tried to salvage what he could.  There were a few grenades they hadn’t found for blowing up the alien ship, some medium combat plating armor he set out to put on after he woke up, as well as a few weapon modifications he could put on this pistol if he ever made it back to the base and had access to the workshop’s tools.  He set his prizes next to the seat and went to sleep.
He slept, strange visions came to him regarding winged angels, demons, and people in his past that had died.  His rest was fitful at times but still needed badly.
When he woke up, outside the window was pure white.  For a moment his heart flashed back to the terror of the ruins before his mind suppressed it.  As he looked closer, it was a heavy mist.  Very strange for the cold ice world.
He slipped the various armor pieces on as the adjusters tightened around his legs and arms, giving very good mobility and protection.  This armor came with an auto-retractor system.  Some people used auto-retractors on their guns or melee weapons, but he always thought they were pathetic.  But he couldn’t help but wonder if it would have saved Aelishun when or however he dropped it.  The system was simple, consisting of a medium-strength cord that innocuously tied the holster to the weapon, and if dropped would quickly reel it back in.
They were really well engineered, he had to admit, but ‘reeling’ his gun back in seemed so unprofessional.  He thought better of it this time and tapped the bottom of the Sledgehammer to the holster, triggering the retractor on this model and let it zip silently back out of the way as the cord connected the two.
The door was open and the steam was warm as he got out of the plane.  Where the hell was he?  It was not cold, and the steam felt comfortable on his face, if it wasn’t for the icy ground he might have thought he was on another planet.
In front of him white smoke piled out of a tunnel.  The darkness added an element of fear Kalco rarely felt.  The steam was lit only by the bright lights from the plane.  As he walked closer he realized it was the passageway of the ship they had come to initially.  There was someone standing there.
“Kalco!”  He saw Feyria wave and with a relief on both their faces, they ran to each other.  She pressed her breasts hard into him and they found each other’s mouth and greedily kissed and bit each other’s lips.
“Holy shit…you are still alive.”  Even though it had not been chronologically that long, given what each had gone through it might as well have been a lifetime.
She shook her head in disbelief; laughing and jumping up to hug him again.  It was a rare moment of joy on this dark tale; the artificially lighting giving an ominous background to this reunion “I waited a long time for you guys to come back.  I saw the V-Plane still had its connection to my Grav-Beacon, and I needed a ride before I froze or starved out here.  Worst case I figure I could go back to whatever I was interrupting.”
She was clearly implying a question about what had happened.  He bit his tongue; it was impossible to explain anything about what he experienced.  “What happened here, what is this?”
“Zaier detonated the explosives.  This steam is the ship melting the ice from all the energy released.”
Moving forward to the tunnel, it was nearly impossible to see down it.  Kalco waved his hand a bit, trying to push the warm steam away before stepping back a few times.  “What happened to him?”
“Dead.”
“He died?”
She nodded solemnly.  “Told me to head back here and wait for you guys, and make sure that I wasn’t caught in the blast.  He had to stay behind to make sure they went off.”
“Brave bastard.  He died down there?”  Kalco nodded downwards and took a step forward, seriously considering going into the steam roiling outwards.
She intercepted him very slightly.  “Yeah, it’s on fire still and collapsed, I think one of those alien cores is melting down.  You can’t go there, I tried.  What happened to Madi?”
Kalco was not immediately convinced but the smoke and steam seemed legitimate enough.
“Madigan was…lost…there.  It was some alien city, it fucks with the mind.  I don’t want to give up on him…”
Feyria interrupted, “I want to go back to Reiko-10 and check on the others, since we can’t communicate with them.”
“Yeah, we can head back to Reiko-10.  Grab some gear and some people and see if we can’t find Madigan…without risking anyone else.”  He was being evasive, and while legitimately wanted to try to save him, he wasn’t sure if Madigan was even alive.  Kalco was sure he wouldn’t physically walk back into that city though.
She nodded.  “I agree.  When I was programming my Grav-Beacon for this point, I also had it set for returning to Ten on the off chance I was too tired or hurt to fly it myself by the time it got here.  That way anyone who could actually get onto the plane could still at least make it to Ten.”
“Well, you are good right?” he asked.
“Yeah.  So what happened there anyway?”
Kalco gripped his fist, pausing for a moment.  “That sensor anomaly was actually an alien city in a cave.  I got separated from Madigan in some sort of group hallucination that almost killed me, and probably killed him.  We can go back and check from a safe distance after we get the others, but…” Kalco shook his head, “I think he is gone.”
“ ‘Gone?’”  She put her hand on her waist, while tilting her head at him.
“Heh…”  He shook his head, running a hand through his unkempt hair twice.  “Complicated as fuck.  It doesn’t make sense, and I lived through it.  We found some sort of alien city ruins, it fucks with your brain, physically nearly killed me.  I woke up, what, almost a cycle later?  He wasn’t around, I think it got him.”  Kalco rubbed his face, trying to not think about what happened but of course it made it worse.  “I didn’t even see his footprints leading into the ruins,” he paused before saying the next line knowing it would make him sound crazy despite how true it felt, “it made me wonder if I was even there with him.”
She came up to him, grabbing his arm and pulling it into her body for comfort.  They hugged each other again, a rare comfort in this nightmare.  “What do you think we are facing?  Is this related to this ship?  To that energy creature?”  So many times in the past her plump breasts pressing into his toned chest would start the stimulation that would end with both of them sweaty and breathing heavy.  Now though, he wasn’t sure what he felt.
“Tsh, I don’t fucking know.”
He was enjoying the embrace when she pushed herself away from him.  “Kalco, this may sound weird but I have been thinking about it a lot, what if all of this is supposed to happen?”
He looked confusedly at her with one eyebrow raised.  “What?”
“I don’t pretend we know much of anything.  Look at me, I’m a fancy pilot with a nice butt, and I like sex…how can we comprehend anything beyond this narrow view?  Are our perceptions vastly distorted?”
He looked at her with skepticism now.  Feyria was smarter than she led on, he knew that from their intimate moments, but something weird was going on here.  She was not the type to wax philosophical, and while she downplayed her intellect, this was not like her.  At least what he thought he knew about her.
She continued, “We kill insects without a momentary thought, and while at some extreme edge they can do damage to us, are their strivings not easily dismissed as pointless?  Of course they are, but what if they realized their role, and actively helped the superior beings around them?  Their efforts to oppose us were found out to be not only in vain, but counter to universal will.”  Feyria was not the rhetorical type as he had known her, not to say they talked much beyond sex or flirting.  This was an intense side to her, maybe not unexpected but certainly unseen.
“I’m not counter to any universal will,” he said more out of his typical defiance.
“We like to think in black and white, of ‘good and evil’ and of course always think we are the good.  Regardless of how foolish that is, what if the entire dichotomy is the fool’s errand?”
“Then we are fools, I guess.”
“Are you the good guy here?”  Her question lacked the pretense of her earlier thought-out question and cut to the heart she sought.
“Yes,” he said without hesitation.
It was silent for a brief moment before she giggled a bit.  “I can’t believe you were taking me serious, I’m just kidding about all that stuff.”  She changed her tone and topic quickly.  “Just getting a bit stir crazy.  The loneliness was getting to me, let’s get out of here.”
“Yeah…”  He wasn’t sure what he thought of her anymore, and he went to walk back to the ship.
“Wait, I got some stuff I salvaged from the ship, come help me.”
He nodded and made his way back to her, stepping a few paces further into the steaming tunnel.  Turning away from the plane and cold, he followed her into the warm tunnel, being led by her hand.  There was one area they came to that was a small cove that the wind patterns kept the steam out of and was mostly clear.  She gestured to a few boxes of stuff that were piled up.  It looked like she was busy as there was a fair amount of items here.
Feyria had bent down, grabbed a small one and started to leave the fog-free zone as Kalco went to grab one of the farther boxes.
She was marching back to the plane with her box, nearly out of the clear air as Kalco was bending down to grab a box himself.  Something was triggering one of his instincts, it didn’t feel right.  He was about to stand up with his box when his situational awareness noticed she had stopped walking.
She had froze at the edge of the fog and he could have sworn he heard a click.  He shifted just a bit, acting like he was moving items in the box, but positioned his forearm armor to reflect what was behind him.  What he saw made his actions clear, as it was her sighting a rifle right at his back.
His stomach knotted, but he was not still alive all this time for no reason.  He had not moved yet, but ran very quickly through his mind how Sledgehammer pistols fired.  He seemed to remember it did not need activation, but it might have a switch on the top left if anything.  For a moment his mind remembered her holding him and laughing deeply at some stupid joke they shared once while in bed, but closed his eyes and mind off to it, instead just cycling through various ways the pistol might fire.
The next moment both of them made their play.  He jumped to the left, spinning and pulling his new pistol out.  He rapidly flicked a spot on the gun which was unnecessary as there was actually no switch and pulled the trigger on her, his heavy armor taking the recoil her body could not.  Her prior setup of the crude ambush had allowed her a burst of gunfire that caught him in the side, most of it deflected by the armor but one or two rounds still hitting him.  
Her unarmored body fared worse as the Sledge pounded her back.  The three rounds that hit made a heavy ‘Dong’ sound as the huge rounds dumped their momentum into her.  The effect resembled what a heavyweight boxer would be like if he had weighted gloves while smashing a featherweight.  She crashed into the wall, lifting her face with a dark pride even if in pain.  She tried raising her rifle back at him.
Kalco had closed the distance and kicked the gun out of her hand, backing up and leveling the pistol at her.
“Finish me, you bastard!” she shouted at him.
“What the fuck are you doing!?”  He put his hand on his waist, pulling back and seeing his hand soaked in red between the armor plates.
“You could never understand.  Your view is far too simplistic, you idiot.”
He was really pissed off, but also confused.  “Why did you do this?”
“Because…”  She started sobbing, her hard face turned into a sad, broken one before she curled into a ball and rolled on her side, moaning from pain.  “Because you are wrong… What is happening here is natural…!  By opposing it, unless we are ready, it ends everything.  It is a natural process we are disrupting!”
“What the hell are you saying?”  Tears were coming to his eyes; a girl he liked so much was bleeding out in front of him.
She lifted a hand up to him and he crouched over her, holding it.  “Kalco…I did love you, I hope you know that.”
“Hold on!”
He ran back to the plane, angry that he was so wasteful with the Medi-kit when he used it on himself and came back with only very bare bones of it remaining.  He remembered so far in the past when everyone was still alive and when she joked to him about how he ‘would owe her double’ if he ever had to use her dumb little Medi-kit that now was so vital, since he was making fun of her unnecessary stashing items at the time.
“Go, you idiot…  I still have the beacon programmed, at least you can make it back to the base.”
He closed his eyes, his tears flowing freely.  He knew in his logical side that he had to leave her here, as he could not trust her.  Even if it meant he was likely leaving her to die.  He bent down, hugging her roughly as their mouths found each other.  He felt her own hands feebly grasping at his jacket, trying to hold his pockets as if for grip.
“I don’t want your pity, but I felt like this was the right thing to do.  Maybe if I didn’t…love you so much I would not have hesitated…”
Her final actions were too much for him.  “God damn it, Feyria!” he yelled.  
Her own eyes were watering.  Her bright eyes had lost their luster as her life force was spilling out from her.  “I don’t expect you to understand.  But do know I always had a love for you that I didn’t feel for others.”
“Fuck!”  He smashed his armored fist into the cold ground.  “Why the hell are you telling me this when you are dying and you just tried shooting me!?”
“One day…maybe you will look back and my actions will make sense.  Why I tried fighting for what I know to be right.”  Her hand pulled out her Grav-Beacon and clicked it, numbers starting to count down.  “Go.”
Kalco choked down a sob, grabbed her, and hugged her hard, trying to remember what she felt like so that perhaps as an old man he could remember the foolish, painful feelings he had for this girl.  He vowed he would live so he could recall Feyria, remember the passionate love they had for each other.
Without saying bye, as it might have been too much for him, he pushed her away hard and ran up the ramp out of a pride that was his only protection right now.
The warm steam turned to cold air, then freezing dry wind outside by the ship.  The darkness was lit only by the light of the plane.  He forced himself up the stairs so he would not have time to think twice about what he had done.  The door sealed up without remorse, and he looked out the window, barely making out what might have been her form huddled down in the foggy tunnel.  The V-Plane spun up, the engines growing louder before it started taking off.
“GOD DAMN IT!”  He pounded the door hard as the tunnel grew smaller and smaller.  He knew he was powerless to stop this now as he was leaving this girl behind.  “Feyria!” he screamed to himself as tears flowed from his face.
Across the mountains, the star had started to cast away the remnants of the night.  Normally sunrise was a happy event, but it made the finality of Feyria’s death hit him harder.
From his pocket something small slipped out; it was a blue injection pen containing the most advanced healing technology the Solarians possessed.  His was lost when he woke up from the ruins.  When she was grasping Kalco, she purposely had slipped him her ReNew Pak.  He picked it up, studying it as if he was a little kid seeing something for the first time.  It was the last thing he had from her, a gift almost like life itself.  For all intents, it was life, and could have easily recovered her deadly injury.
“FEYRIA…WHY!?”
He slumped against the wall of the plane, crying as he held Feyria’s ReNew Pak in his hands covering his face.

 
Laina
Day-3, Morning
Location: Reiko-10, Alpha Wing

The smoking remains of a part of Alpha wing were comforting as the Solarians still alive would not come here to find her.  Watching the lightning fork and dance in the middle of the harsh snow storm was a calming sight to her; it felt like reality on some level.   Events were shaping up nicely, though the difficulty was obvious in what still needed to be done.  She looked down at her hand, moving the fingers one at a time; this form was so strange now that she knew the truth.  
Perhaps ‘Laina’ had been this thing her whole life, but the line between Laina and reality was now blurred because she understood and was changed forever.  She turned to her right, seeing a broken figure standing there looking at her with its empty shell.  So strange that had she reached the higher reality, whereas this one had not.  In a way she understood there was a gulf of difference due to a complex Axl compatibility, even if they were on the same side.
The creature to her side begged for an ending, as it had been wounded by that defiant man, Solide.  It would serve the cause loyally, but wanted an escape from this nightmare as all did.  Laina would grant it that.
She stabbed her hand forward right into its torso, pulling up violently as the body was unzipped as and a temporary fountain of blue gore went upwards as the body fell to the ground.  There was so much difference for so similar a beginning.  Two others were behind and waited dutifully for their higher one’s will to act on.
She turned back to the window, noting things were not right here.  She knew not everyone in the other group was dead; she could feel and see what had occurred to them.  With a joy she knew there was now another among them.  Two had been killed before they could stop the truth from emerging.  Her one ally now also knew the truth.  They would understand the dauntless quest they were on.
This base must be destroyed, that way there was no way what the others were attempting to do could stop what needs to be done.  They of course would think they were ‘right’, delusional though it may be; however at the end Laina’s cause it had to be complete.  This madness simply must end.  All will accept the true embrace, even if forced to come to it.  Reality was not something many could be convinced of, and it really didn’t matter in the end if they understood it, so much as they were not in the way.
She raised her hand and a careful observer – perhaps more in tune on a spiritual level than a wholly physical one – might have noticed a blade of energy above her as she moved her hand downwards, crushing through the wall like nothing as the howling wind came ripping in.  The hard-gained heat poured out quicker than blood from some of the worst wounds she had ever treated in a different past.  She would make short work of this base, then it would really be over.  The others would freeze and this would be a victory – even if Laina died.  She was not selfish; she knew this form was but a small piece of a larger whole.
She was hit with a spray of liquid to her right as one of the mutated figures slumped down the wall from something impacting it with tremendous force.  Something had smashed it into the wall hard enough to kill it.
Laina turned to the right, seeing someone standing there, and despite her next statement, it did not surprise her in retrospect.  Of course…why there were initially ten survivors made so much sense from the plane Laina operated on; things like this could be expected.  Destroying the base to preserve the cause would have to wait until this distraction was dealt with.
“I thought you were dead.”  A dark, enjoyable smile came across Laina’s face.  “You have no idea how much more fun this makes this!”


 
Aria
Day-3, Midday
Location: APC driving to Ancient Ship

The Armored Personal Carrier bounced off a fairly decent sized hill, Aria’s hair flying upwards from the drop before the vehicle smashed back down on the ground.  The impact might have been harder without the advanced shocks, so she hardly noticed it.  The rear tires fishtailed a bit before the knobby front tires ripped through the snow and ice and she was off again.  The blizzard was powerful however the APC was hard to stop.  Installed variations of repulsors kept the windows clear and plowed the snow out of the way easily, as it was designed to shovel corpses away at much greater weights in the craziest of battle zones.
Aria’s face was calm and emotionless like always but in her mind the situation was chaotic.  Only one person in her mind possessed a competent enough understanding to find any solution.  She knew enough to know when she was mentally out-classed.  She was a Sniper and a medic; understanding Death Angels and traitors was beyond her.
She glanced down quickly at a screen with a passive scan of anything nearby, noticing a waypoint marker guiding her towards the source of energy the group left for some many days ago.  There was no way to know if they were still alive, if they were still there, or if anything else may have happened.  Regardless, back at Reiko-10 was hopeless whereas there was at least some bit of hope if she could get to him.  She was closing in but there was nothing she saw so far, just endless snow-blasted hills silhouetted by the gray sky of the sun.
Up ahead through the wall of snow something looked like a solid wall of white.  She slowed down as she approached what apparently was a deep fog.  The high beam lights of the vehicle could not pierce very thickly and she drove slow as she progressed forward.  Something was definitely going on here, which was a relief to her indicating at least her trip was not in vain.
It was only thick for a little as it thinned out once she got to the base of a very large hill with a structure jutting out of it.  It looked almost like a steam factory as all the fog was coming from the top of the structure.  As she watched, she saw what looked like water melting off en masse off it, steaming away and causing the strange fog within a blizzard.  Partly up the structure was a hill with a dark, beckoning tunnel that led inwards that some steam was also coming out of.
The APC roared hard as it drove up the steep hill over to the entrance, getting as close as she could.  It was too small for the vehicle to go any farther so she put it in idle, grabbed Broken Promise along with some other gear, and headed outside.  The temperature and weather were weird here.  The snow was partly rain due to the heat from the structure, and around her she could not look far due to the thick fog hanging over the area.
Her armor plates shifted fluidly as she walked down into the tunnel, giving almost zero encumbrance despite the protection.  The beams off the APC lit a far amount of the opening, and it was clear this was not a geologic formation but part of the melting structure outside.  
Hey eyes snapped to a puddle of blood on a spot near here.  Holding Broken Promise in front of her, stepped towards the blood.  In the low-light the light on her suit automatically turned on, giving the Sniper an unfortunate fear that she could not see nearly as far as she could shoot.
There was an opening of the tunnel to the side like a small cove.  Inside it looked like there was a small fight as there were blood splatters on the far wall.  There was a collection of small supplies here which were likely from the original group, but the blood suggested it did not end peacefully.  Turning back to the main tunnel, she saw a trail of blood heading further down into the darkness.
That this was not a natural cave some became clear.  The engineering soon became evident to her that this was not Solarian at all.  The overall design reminded her of a ship in that there was a logic of sorts to room layout, and that towards the core appeared to be the more useful or important rooms, based on the consoles and space.
Not far in she came to a room that a large battle had occurred at.  Bullet holes riddled a side of the room that was nearly consumed in an explosion.  She careful peeked around the corners, leveling her rifle but not seeing any targets.  There were no bodies she could find however.
She heard a click and spun to the right, but saw nothing other than dark shadows cast by the strange shapes of things she could not understand in the construction of the ship.  On the ground she saw the red trail, which stuck out to her.  After dealing with everything on Reiko-10 she learned that these enemies did not ‘bleed’ in any conventional sense; that meant Solarian blood.  She lifted her head as the trail disappeared into the darkness of a long hallway.
It was hard to not let doubts of what she was doing creep into her mind as she walked this strange alien structure.  Aria was a Classed Soldier but was far out of her element here.  Closed and tight quarters cramped in on her.  She may get one lucky shot off on her gun in a snapshot sort of way, but long sight lines and time to aim were nil.
The trail took a few turns as it progressed towards a green light.  She nervously walked into a huge open room.  Immediately she stepped back as she realized there was a far drop below her.  Being this high triggered an emotional response she was surprised she still held, a memory of when she still believed in certain things.  Strange pylons moved up and down with a regularity that was off beat to Solarian understanding.  Connecting one side of this pulsing spherical room to the other was a long walkway that seemed dangerous to cross.
She remembered the blood trail and looked back down at it, seeing it got momentarily thicker before rapidly terminating at the body of a female with thin, athletic legs.  Aria didn’t see the face, but the long hair and lithe build told her everything she needed to know that Feyria was dead in front of her.
Aria held her weapon in front of her looking for what may have killed her.
“Hey!”  The word scared her perhaps more than an enemy would have, and across the long walkway she saw a man waving.  She added a small lens of nanites over her eyes to magnify and reveal it was Zaier, his right shoulder bleeding.  He held a rifle in his right hand and his left was clutched over the blood.  “Wow…am I glad to see you.”
He hobbled forward a bit, and she watched as soft purple lights appeared on the walkway near where he was like an energy fence of sorts.  Maybe this is what prevented falls off the thinner-than-comfortable aisle.  Every couple of steps he would stagger partly, the energy shield of the bridge appearing.  Twice she thought he would fall, but merely bumped off the energy field.
Aria felt her cold heart well up for a moment.  “Zaier…you are alive.”
“Aria…”  He coughed a bit, stepping forward towards her.
“What happened?”
“This ship was infested with Death Angels.  They attacked us and Feyria died.  Kalco killed her.”
“Death Angel?  Kalco!?”
He shook his head, closing his eyes and mistaking her question as if she had not seen them before.  “Some dimensional being.  They look a bit like us, but have these energy wings behind them.  They attack with some sort of light or manifested physical objects.”
Aria did not correct him, and instead asked, “Where are the rest?”
He scoffed, turning his head.  “Cowards ran during a fight with one of them.  I think we may have killed it, but when the battle was over they were gone.  Little Madigan was looking for a reason to cut her loose since he hated her, and Kalco merely ran to save his selfish self.  They left us at this ship to die, Madigan stole the V-Plane.
“Feyria pulled the ship back, but only Kalco came back alive.  Alone.  Likely after finishing off Madigan.  I was wounded and Feyria tried to stop him, but that bastard shot her.  She was almost dead by the time I got to her, I brought her where it was warmer, but there was nothing I could do for her.”  He pulled his hand off his shoulder, looking at the blood on his glove before placing it back.  “I took a pretty bad hit earlier myself.”
Aria glanced back at the dead Feyria.  Railine had died by the glass plate sticking through his chest and Zaier talked as if it was generally the same.  But unlike Railine, her hunched back looked riddled with holes unlike Death Angel wounds.  Kalco apparently had killed her…  “I feel really bad.  He shot her near the tunnel entrance.  She made it down this far, only to die.”
“Let me help you,” Aria said.
“No, I’ll be okay.  What happened with you?  Why are you here, where are the others?”
There was so much to say, and she was the wrong person to do it.  In an awkward way, she listed the events like there were nothing more than a grocery list.  “Rox was killed by Solide, Laina and Ryla isolated themselves, Railine died fighting a Death Angel that was on the base.  Later Solide and I killed that one he wounded.  The base was on fire and falling apart.”  She felt what may have been a tear in her eye but was likely mistaken.  “I came looking for you.”
“I’m glad.”
“What is this place?”
“It’s a ship from what I can tell, maybe our way out of here.”
He stumbled to his knee, Aria ran forward and grabbed his shoulder. “Let me treat it.”  She pulled a small bag out and began shaking two bottles up.  “Take off your coat on that arm.”
“No, I’m fine.”
She shook her head no, and pulled his coat away to reveal a gunshot through his shoulder, or a hole of some kind.  Maybe the Death Angel shot some small javelins out.
“…Thanks…even if I hate asking for help.”
She was pulling his coat back and noticed his bare chest and neck.  “Hey… Don’t you usually wear a necklace?  Where did it go?”
He patted his neck absentmindedly.  “Oh, I must have forgotten to put it on that morning.”
Forgotten.
It was fortunate Aria’s face was always so neutral because something major had clicked in her mind.
“Hope it helped,” she said emotionlessly as she walked back to where she had dropped some of her medical pack.
“It did, thanks.  So what do we do now?”
She replied without turning to him.  “I hoped you would have the answer.  You never asked others for their opinion before.”
“I think we wait it out here.  We might be able to use this ship to get off of this planet; it appears to have started up.”
Without turning her head, she shifted her eyes back to Feyria.  She had a tight group of holes blown through her heart; it was an expert shot by someone with a projectile weapon.  
“Do you remember Suzene?” Aria asked.
Zaier paused a while.  “Can’t say I do, so much has happened.”  The words were wounds to her heart.
The next question, considering the truth of the situation was odd to ask, but it would implicate so much.  “You do not remember Valent?”
“No, don’t remember him…”  Zaier had interpreted the question wrong, which answered everything to Aria.  His eyes were closed.  “All I have gone through recently.”  He groaned.  “Ugh…can you check my shoulder again?”  He opened his eyes with what felt like a pleading look on his face.  It did not last long as he processed what was next.  “What are you…?”
Aria had her rifle leveled and without a word pounded three rapid shots at Zaier.  The first of the upgraded weapon’s rounds blew the top of his head off, as the next two punched clean fist-size holes right through his body.  Perhaps taking a note from the wrong person, she grabbed two grenades and rolled them at his body as they engulfed him in flames.  Her earlier assessment about the safety rails proved accurate as his slumped and burning body was held up by the purple light.
“Valent promised he would always remember.” 
She smiled a rare smile to herself.  Yes, he did promise her that, didn’t he?  She nodded to herself.
Of course he did.
She giggled, and did a few small girlish skips as she walked past both bodies.  She felt light on her feet, the weight off her soul tangible.  She skipped some more, perhaps for a life never lived when she was younger.
Suddenly a sharp pain came to her.  She looked down at her wrist, seeing a pink piece of glass sticking through it and white stuff leaking out of her arm.  Interesting!  She laughed for the first time in a while.  It was not over yet, was it?  Her laughs continued louder and louder.

 
Kalco
Day-3, Midday
Location: V-Plane auto-pilot back to Reiko-10


The fact that Kalco was still alive didn’t surprise him; he was the best.  Naturally.  Apparently, he might be the only one left alive, though.
This is Kalco, I am returning on the V-Plane.  Is anyone left alive?  He broadcast on his ICS on an open frequency to the base he was rapidly descending towards.  He sent it again and again, but still nothing.  Knowing what had happened made him far more cautious and he had salvaged what he could from Feyria’s stores.  Among the things he had found was a force field bracer which would create a strong repulsive field to protect him from a majority of attacks.  It might help.  Maybe.
The sad thing though was all the people around him that were dead.  Feyria staying back to sacrifice herself with Zaier was a bit unpredicted, he had to admit to himself.  Guess she liked Zaier more than him.  She was pretty fun to have sex with but always seemed a touch insatiable – that she was missing something to make her life whole.  Kalco enjoyed rough sex but even for him there was a limit to how much pain he would inflict while engaging in so-called pleasure.  Well, now she was dead, just like so many others here; only an unknown few remained alive.  Being a sole survivor had its downsides.
What was occurring here was far more complicated than any of these regulars were likely to comprehend or to live though.  He was at his own personal limits so that was really why the others stood no chance at all.  It did not make complete sense why there was an alien ship here, apparently frozen a long time ago.  Kalco knew it was not related to the ‘Death Angels’, at least not directly as they had been at other planets before and did not need a ship.  He hated that term – it was far to drool – but it would be way out of place to correct it, and really it was just a name anyway.
What was disturbing though, is as much as Kalco knew, it left only bad conclusions as to what that ancient ship meant.  It definitely seemed to be older than modern Aelisha, which left dark questions.  Like the precocious Madigan suggesting they were Gen-1 Aelisha ships, it was correct on an indisputable level that some very old ships were in some ways better than even the most modern of ones.  The answers were gone forever in the sands of time, or the frozen wastes of Reiko.
The pre-programmed V-Plane landed on the short runway and glided silently into the Hangar where it shut off, likely forever as the only person left alive who could even begin to potentially fly this was that young girl Ryla.  
What he saw next complicated the situation as it was not clear what it meant.  The Gryo-Copter was destroyed where it had once stood.  Slashed apart, it lay in pieces and unlike the V-Plane which still had potential to fly, this thing would never again be air-worthy.  He wondered who and why it was sabotaged, but then saw a pile of bodies of the black figures around the copter.  Their distorted wings looked like dead old trees at an abandoned graveyard.  The only thing wrong with the metaphor is the occasional brilliant color on the wing’s crystal plate.
The more he looked, the more it appeared there was a battle here with a fair amount of holes blown in the hangar wall behind the copter.  It was tough to tell but there was a battle here certainly, as to when the copter was destroyed he would not be able to piece it together quickly.
Gratefully someone had left the Lift-bike behind instead of it being at the ground vehicle bay; probably whoever came to fight at the Gyro-Copter.  For a moment he considered that it was odd the person had not taken the Lift-Bike back, but it didn’t much matter now.  He felt slightly better with his prospects at this base, as nothing appeared destroyed here; but decided it would still be a good idea to scout the perimeter to see what was going on.
He hopped on the bike and in response it powered up quickly, the three grav plates humming to life with a comforting light coming from below them.  A field enveloped around him to help protect him from the elements and he punched a button to configure the controls to that of old Terran motorcycles and left the hover distance low.  He slowly approached the door and it slid open automatically.  He gunned it as he shot out away from the base with a long wave behind him, enjoying a rare moment of pleasure in this collapsing nightmare.
He rolled his hand down hard, the Lift-bike roaring loudly as he launched off a tall icy rock; the freedom and the falling made his stomach rise but he loved this feeling.  The repulsors softened the ‘impact’ so he never came close to the ground.  They had an interesting effect of blowing away the snow as well as he ripped forward, leaving a long rooster tail behind him as he sped back around to scan the edges of Reiko-10.  
Kalco did not have high hopes for anyone at this base, as both the Ancient Ship and the Sensor Anomaly were both present with True Forms…eh ‘Death Angels’, rather.  There were some dark alien powers at work here, and Reiko-10 likely had them for sure.  The only ones here he had any faith in were Aria and Solide.
He had not spent much time with either of them but they felt like Classed soldiers.  Aria seemed like one with the way she carried herself, Sniper Class that seemed obvious for her; and Solide likely Assault given his aggression.  The problem was that they both had that feel to them but never opened their mouth to reveal for sure, so good of those little soldiers.  
The snow was blowing wildly as he skipped over another hill, coming into the flat basin surrounding the base.  It was still standing which he was grateful for, but also saw one of the wings destroyed, charred to the ground.  He slowed the throttle down a bit and slowly looked over the base.  He saw some Mutated Figures in the distance but they would never catch him on this.  A close one lunged at him but with a quick motion of his hands the bike responded and shot forward, leaving it chasing him to no avail.  He lapped the base once and saw it had seen better days.  A few walls looked crashed in but loosely repaired shut.
This was the perfect setting for the hero to make his grand entrance.  Tragic he had been forced to gun down one of his loves, but now he would return triumphantly back here to save the others at the moment of impending doom.  Uncanny that he was gearing up to be the sole survivor again; but this time he would bring the hot Laina with him as they escaped this craterous, ruined world.  Yes, her soft embrace would be so welcome after the long trip that left all the others dead.
Smoke rose from one of the wings of the base, but the fire had been stopped.  Other than the occasional creature he saw out here, the base was not as bad as could be expected with True Forms present.  Someone was likely alive, but why hadn’t they responded to him?
Floating over to the ground vehicle bay he lifted his pistol and blasted one creature a few times that was bashing on the door.  It dropped silently in the snow storm; only a fraction of its strange broken wing hung above the deep snow.  As the bike got close the door slowly rolled open to show the empty bay.  The A.P.C. was gone, meaning at least one person was alive at one point and had left.  He swung the bike in, moving it to a corner and flipped it to point back outside.  Stepping off, the small force field that was enveloping him left and the cold that was the reality on this planet came at him fiercely again.
He adjusted some of the plating on his armor, tuned on the force field bracer he had, and in general was much better equipped coming back here than when he left.  Even in his mind he was more prepared for whatever he might find here.
Entering the main room was much more different than the cycles ago he left.  It was clear the room had sustained multiple battles, as some of the lights were shot out, bodies were torn apart on the floor, and liquid of some kind was pooling in a corner.  One entire part of the room was charred from a fire or explosion.
There were a few splatters of blood on the wall and a pool that had dried around the outline of a body that had been moved as nothing was there any more.  Further down the hall he heard some crashes and he lightly jogged towards it, peeking around the corner.
resulted in the head being blown off of one creature, and the other now missing its shoulder complex; both fell to the floor soon after.  As he watched, Solide came over in a partial-enclosed set of power armor.  He had a dark grin on as he stomped the head in with a crushing boot, and pulled the trigger on the other one; the shells must have been explosive or upgraded in some way as the body was blown apart.
“Solide,” Kalco said firmly, ready to duck if he looked unstable.  Solide swung his weapon towards the sound, and then lowered it, putting a hand to his face as he started laughing.
“Someone still alive in this fucked up nightmare?”
Kalco came out into the open.  He was confident enough in his snap shot to take it if Solide tried anything.
Solide continued, “Old Fucking Kalco…how the hell should I have known you’d still be alive?  Only one to live last time, too.”  His last statement gave Kalco pause.  What was it in reference to?  The terms were the same, but it was mere coincidence.
“What happened here?”  
Solide closed his eyes as if to block the memories.  “It doesn’t really matter.  Half these fucking bitches aren’t even Solarian…did you know that?”  Kalco bit his lip for a moment as Solide kept talking.  “Back from the dead and all that shit.”  He lowered his head and began laughing.  “Haha….HAHAHAH!”  He raised his face to the ceiling.  “I bet you aren’t even Solarian either, which was why you lived the first fucking time too!  I should have seen that actually.  I wondered how someone like you was tougher, but if you weren’t one of us, that makes it all click.  Click click boom!”  He fired his shotgun at an already blown apart body, the violence unnecessary.  “Fills me with pride knowing I was the only Solarian to survive back then.”
“Are you the only one?”
The man that very few people trusted snapped his head towards the Squad Leader.  “Heh….I bet they asked you that too…didn’t they?  Did you know you were wrong at the time?  Did you!?”
“What are you talking about?”  Kalco’s fingers were slowly tracing their way down the handle of Sledgehammer.
“I don’t blame you, not like you did anything wrong.  For a long time, I hated your fucking ass, that you were the hero and I barely fucking made it out, but…”  He lifted both hands, smiling darkly.  “I killed enough people that I got over it.  Plus you saved me.  I don’t let debts like that go.”
“You’re Classed.”  It was more of an accusation than a question.  Kalco still didn’t understand what Solide was implying and was trying to piece it together.
“The story goes deeper than you might realize.”
Kalco asked, “Are we the only ones left?”
“Well, do I include the bitches I killed that apparently don’t die?”  Solide took a step towards him, the broken part of the armor on his leg hissed from a leaking hydraulic line.
“Who is left?” he repeated in a different way.
“This all started at fucking Seven, you know.”
“Stop,” Kalco said firmly, believing the man had a narrow grasp on cognition.  Talking to him would not be useful but he could still use the man.  “You may be right, I think there may be an answer at Seven myself.  I’m going to go back.  Can you protect this base?  I have a few extra weapons if you need them.”
He smirked.  “I got ol’ Claim Jumper right here, ol’ fucking Kalco.”
‘Claim Jumper’.  Holy shit…the name of his weapon froze Kalco.  Braid had a weapon named the same thing.  But he died in a final stand during the Elyria Modality, and Solide didn’t look anything like him.  It had to be coincidence, a lot of Classed named their custom weapons.  Maybe Solide even recovered his weapon on a later mission on that planet.  ‘Yeah no way’, he assuaged his subconscious.  Just like Aria and her ‘Broken Promise’ meant nothing; he’d known a Support with a Sweep Rifle named that, so it wasn’t completely unlikely.
He needed to leave.  “I will be back, then.”  He did the awkward move of walking away while watching him to avoid getting shot.
He ran back to the bike, grabbed a couple of grenades off of the back, a shotgun and a few miscellaneous items, and left them on the other side of the door.  Solide would see them and use them.  Kalco had seen people break apart before, as long as Solide kept on that narrow path of shooting enemies at the base, it was useful to Kalco.
Laina! – Kalco shouted to just her address.  Nothing.  He shouted a few more but no response.  It was not conclusive, given the constant interference on the planet, and she easily could have been in the APC.  Hopefully.
Reiko-10 was a big base, so if someone wanted to stay hidden they probably could have, but with Solide like that, it was unlikely anyone else was alive.  Kalco would probably have to kill him when he came back.  He hopped back on the bike, the protective energy field went up, and he shot off through the door into the snow again.
Reiko-7 would hold as much of a clue as anywhere else.  At this point he was somewhat consigned to likely dying here.  Given his past he would not give up, but it was reality.  At most he could gather as much information as he could.  He hit throttle to max, and swept the grav plates to their highest setting as he shot off over the mountainous terrain.
Trying to convert the bike to full airborne mode, an alarm started flashing red, showing a display on the plates about they were damaged.  He had not seen the alarm before as he had not tried to go airborne, but as for now he would not be able to actually fly so much as simply hover off the ground as he had previously.
He was not a daredevil but certainly enjoyed the now-ness these sorts of things gave him.  The fact that a crash would end his life so instantly helped block his mind from the longer lingering death further away.  At this rate he could go almost as fast as a regular pilot in some of the aerial vehicles; not nearly as safe, certainly, but time was ticking.  The sun was bright overhead which made the ride far easier as he could see ahead of him.  Still, the speeds he was going and only being a little off the ground gnawed at the edge of his brain.
Seven was moderately far, and the rhythmic bounce of launching off the hills lulled him into his mind of wondering what happened to Laina.  Solide may have shot her, given his ‘bitches I killed’ comment.  More reason to end him if there was any way out of here.  Hell, Kalco may do it out of principle.  Had there been a True Form at Ten?  It would take so much for them to over-power it.  Maybe that is why no one was around.
But…the A.P.C. was gone from the vehicle bay.  Maybe no one was dead and Laina had escaped with the others!
Kalco shook his head, not permitting himself to go that way, it would only distract him.
He came upon the burnt out husk of Seven.  Unlike the first time it was completely frigid and had long stopped smoking.  He parked the bike near the crushed door everyone had crawled through the first time.  His suit lights clicked on, as he crawled back in the dark central room that he was in seemingly so long ago.  
Walking towards the hall they had went down previously he stopped as he caught the light glinting off something weird.  From under a door was a sparkly substance much different from snow.  Being a quick learner he snapped his light off and saw that it glowed a soft blue and purple.
“That same stuff…it’s spreading.”  He had no intention of exploring that entire hallway that had been overran by the strange spreading crystals they had unleashed from the room the first time they were here and went to go in the other direction when something new caught his eye.  “A girl?”
On the floor in the center of the room was a girl with her eyes open in shock and holding her bloody stomach.  She was long since dead and frozen but it told a story even if he was not able to understand it.  There was not a girl here the first time they came here.  Sure there were people killed all over the base, but most were charred, dismembered, and frozen before the crew arrived, and certainly there was no one here, of that he was positive.
That meant there was a survivor somewhere hidden on this base.  Someone that did not come out when they were here.  Maybe she arrived later, but with no vehicles outside it was easier to conclude she was here to start with.  He could not blame her after whatever she must have witnessed at her own base, but to watch them silently…only to die later.  Sad and preventable, as they could have rescued her from Seven.
For a moment he thought about how the girl could have been saved, but then a different part of his brain reminded him of the horror of Elyria and now regarded the body with suspicion.  There was no way to tell if she was innocent or if it was a trap.
What the…?
Near her body was a small orange box with a grip on it.  It looked a bit like a portable vacuum mixed with a handheld weapon; something akin to a fictional phaser but with a black/orange motif.  He grabbed the weapon, hearing a voice, ‘Vainglory does not recognize you’.
“What?”  He spun around then looked at the girl, but she was certainly dead.  Her mouth hung open gasping for a hope that never came.  He pulled out a quick disconnect cable, attaching it to the grip so that the weapon would retract in event he accidentally let it go, and it silently rolled up to his waist before he pulled it back down to look at it more close.  He had to laugh at himself, now actually using the retract cables after losing his Aelishun.
He aimed to the side and pulled the trigger, lights starting to move around the barrel.  It surprised him and a smile soon formed on his face.  It appeared it was some sort of charging thing, but he wasn’t sure when it actually fire though.  He let go, figuring he could use it later.
‘Kallll….coooo…’
He spun around again, not expecting anything until he was staring at a ghostly spirit floating down the hall towards him.
“Holy shit…”  His heart dropped at the sight of the True Form.  What the hell were they doing here!?  In panic he looked down, thinking the girl was the trap, but her frozen, dead body hung in its soulless stare as it had before.
Quickly lifting the strange weapon he had just acquired, he pulled the trigger at the True Form coming towards him.  This fated weapon would extinguish this cursed thing from this realm.  He’d be the hero.  Naturally.
Click.  Click.  “What the fuck!?”  He slapped it once, pulling it a few more times.  The lines around the barrel spun but it did nothing.  He threw the useless weapon down and it silently wound back up to his waist as he grabbed the not-as-good Aelishun replacement, the Sledgehammer, and fired at the True Form.  A few bursts of blue gas-blood blew out the back of the attractive feminine face.  
Nearly as fast, a mix of glass blades formed in front of it.  It raised its arm and soon after energy beams rained towards him.  He was already running and that was about the only thing that saved him.  Dashing towards the little hole out, he went sprawling forward as he felt a pain in his lower back.  
Hit.  Hit for sure. The pain was threatening to cause a black out. 
He couldn’t stop…he kept crawling and crawling towards that hole.  Just get to the bike.  Get the hell out of this nightmare.
The beams were raining around him as the entire structure of Reiko-7 was collapsing.  He drug himself as fast as he could like a rat to a little hole.  His left leg kicked well but the right was not working hardly at all.
His light was buried in the snow, but the being behind him radiated a light bright enough for him to see his escape, even if he was sure he was bleeding out.  Even if he got to the bike, could he ride it?  Yes, he was the hero.  He would do it all, naturally!
‘Just keep going.  I can’t give up!’ he thought to himself.
“I’m the fucking hero!” he yelled to the crumbling chaos around him.  It was the last words spoken at Reiko-7.
 
Aria
Day-3, Afternoon
Location: APC returning to Reiko-10

For the first time in a while Aria felt free.  What perhaps could be as close to a smile as the untrained muscles in her face were, she hummed to herself as she drove back to Reiko-10.  
She replayed Zaier’s final moments, and each time it brought a deeper smile until she started giggling a couple times, imaging his body pounded back by the rounds.  Looking down momentarily, she had treated her wound very effectively and other than the cut in her jacket there was little evidence of it.  Zaier’s final attack had surprised her, but it was oddly satisfying being able to shoot him a few more times.
It never was supposed to end this way, but she could face it happily; she had done her end perhaps.  Now it was freeing.  Yes she felt quite good with the cross she no longer bore on her.  When did she ever put it there?  Did it really serve any purpose?  She laughed again.  It felt good to be happy and free.  Yes she would enjoy her time well.
From this angle of where she was coming back from, at least one wing of the base was destroyed, the walls were caved in, and snow had covered what was once a hallway.  The A.P.C. rolled into the vehicle bay and she took note that the Lift-Bike was gone; perhaps that lunatic Solide had gone off to hunt someone down.  She powered down the vehicle, giddy as she had reached her final resting place one way or another.
Coming into the main room, she noticed that it had changed somewhat.  The bunkers had been expanded and there were more of the broken angel/monster bodies littering the floor.  Exploded gore around the rooms suggested there was much fighting here.  She took a step and noticed there were a pile of weapons laying in a group, indicating that someone had definitely left them.  She had no intention of dropping Broken Promise, and grabbed a couple grenades and a small Medi-kit and skipped a few times laughing at her own silliness.  There was no way she was making it out alive, but had felt at peace with this.
One wing was destroyed, and there was heat and smoke coming from another that was likely on fire down at the far end.  She moved some of the objects the person had arranged around here and made a chair of sorts in the center of the room.  Yes, a quiet, perfect place.
Sitting there, thinking of her life and how it had passed her by, she wondered if anyone was still here, given that at one point Solide, Ryla, and Laina were all alive.  She turned to face Beta wing and looked to see any evidence of Laina or Ryla.  She felt a duty others that many would not understand and stood up to go look for them to at least try to ensure their safety it at all possible.  She carefully crept along, but the base was very quiet, as far as the creatures went.  There was a howling of wind, and a cool breeze coming from here, but no hostiles.  
The search could easily have taken a while to try to find someone in the large complex, but Aria found one of them very quickly.  Part of her search came to an unceremonious end when she found the body of young Ryla bent over on the ground.  A dried pool of blood surrounding some sort of entry wound told Aria there was no need to actually check any sign of life.  The injury did not particular bad, but perhaps Ryla was frail and why she succumbed so easily.
Aria continued to the end of the hall at Beta wing, looking outside and not seeing anything either.  Turning, she saw an abandoned shack that looked like it had a light on.  This was quite strange as the lights were usually off, given everything happening it was extra suspicious.  Usually tools were stored there, and sometimes people went there just to get away from people.
Consigned to her fate, the exploration seemed justified; curiosity tends to become powerful when life becomes worthless in certain circumstances.  She forced the door open against the snow and trudged outside, feeling the air rip into her even through the armor and winter clothing.
She had seen the building before, but had never been inside, and when she opened it what she saw surprised her.  The room was lit by a single light hanging from the ceiling and there was a chair bolted to the floor with some cords running to it.  In the corner was a woman who looked bloodied, standing with her hands behind her back looking out a window.  “Hello, Aria,” she said without looking.
Aria stood in the doorway with several thoughts running through her head.
Laina turned to face her.  “Such a weird room…Solarians sure are cruel, are they not?”
Aria did not answer.  The snow ripped into the small shack, as the doorway was hardly blocked by her thin body.
Laina’s face looked beat up pretty badly.  One of her eyes were closed and was dripping blood, but still she remained looking fairly stoic.  “Why have a room meant solely to torture or perhaps kill another?”  Laina suddenly laughed. “Though to answer my own question, isn’t it at the edge of death where so many of these truths lie?”
“What happened here?”  There was blood pooled around the chair.  Aria could piece together some sort of torture scenario, but completely unsure why it would exist.
“There’s not many of us left here,” Laina answered.  “Three…Two?  And then there were none.”  Laina lifted a hand and rubbed her bloodied eye, but did not open it.  “I have a question for you.  Do you know what you are?”
“Yes.  You?”
“Of course.  I wondered through, because when Railine was hit, I knew you also took a small hit, yet you stand here in front of me with…nothing.”  Laina smiled at the word choice.  “Then with Zaier you murdered him so easily, and were wounded again and now you stand here with a depraved look on your face when it should be so much more.  You have been infected, yet you do not change.”
Aria’s mind jumped.  “How did you know about Zaier?”  The attack Aria sustained at the ship was covered by the placement of her jacket; she made sure to do so after drawing the alien projectile out of her arm.
Laina turned her head back outside, her unkempt hair fitting the somewhat wild woman.  “This plane is so easy to understand once awoken.  It’s powerful in a really strange way given it’s ironic position.  Do you know what I may be?”  She turned back, pointing to the chair.  “No need for barbaric things like this between us at this point.”
Aria said, “I have some guesses, given that everyone else here seems to be dead.”  Laina opened her bloody eye, only instead of a Solarian eye it looked like a vertical pupil.  She brushed some blood away, revealing black markings down her face not unlike a Strive but Aria knew it was far worse.  “It got to you, didn’t it?  Somehow you got triggered.”
“How ironic, you talking like you are Solarian at all, hiding your own wounds like you are.”  Aria cowered a little at the true accusation, hitting a deep root of shame.  “Worse, you pretend you were Railine’s friend, but you let him hang, withering under my accusations regarding his blood test idea.”  Laina brushed some more blood off of her face, the dark marks very were obvious now that Aria was looking for them.  “You kept your mouth shut not because of the way you are, but because you were scared of what he would find with you.  You knew as well as I did that his test would show things from both of us we would prefer to keep hidden.   How perfect that he died taking a hit for you.”
If Aria possessed any set of normal emotions she would be crying, but her emotions were quite distorted.  “I felt bad, but in a different time he might understand.”
“I don’t think he would.  You would normally stand zero chance, but two of your companions did quite a bit of surprising damage to me.  It was unfortunate that Zaier was not able to do more damage to you, beyond that final attack that hit you before he was granted eternal relief.  I will grant you the same, because I do this out of a love you would never understand.  I truly pity you, and that is why I give you salvation.”
Aria went to preemptively shoot her as well, but as she was bringing up her rifle, a glass shard impaled her shoulder.  
Laina spread her arms by her side as she slowly floated off the floor, and in a few moments crystal wings began phasing in and out of existence.  They flickered in and out of reality a few times before fully becoming established and real.
Aria was a soldier, and a good one at that.  It was a blow that would incapacitate many, but she grabbed the shard, ripping it straight out along with fluid before bringing the rifle on Laina, firing rapidly.  A small burst of blue came out of her that quickly disappeared, but overall it had little effect, unlike Zaier which blew his physical body apart.
She pulled a grenade, activated it, and threw it at the medic before dashing through the door outside.  She had only taken a few steps before the entire shack was blown apart as flaming wood was raining down on her face-down form in the snow.  She turned around to see Laina there with seemingly no effect.  It was eerie seeing the woman floating in the air silhouetted by the flames on the otherwise dark, snowy night.  The crystalline wings looked foreboding against the flames.
Bringing Broken Promise to bear she pulled the trigger again before her right arm holding the barrel fell to her side.  She looked in shock at the dismemberment from a small burst of the crystal weapons that cut it cleanly off.  A few cables hissed in her arms as white substrate fluid spurted out momentarily.
“I look at you with disgust, honestly.  I am not sure I can even save your type.  Do you have a soul?”  Laina asked.
Aria could not fire the weapon one handed as it was far too heavy and awkward.  She sat there kneeling, looking up at the hovering Laina.  The tears that formed in Aria’s eyes were rare.
Laina said continuing, “The saddest thing is the frailty of this dimension.  Even someone like you, rendered inert by a single glancing attack.  What real hope do you have?”
“ ‘Hope…?’ ” Aria repeated.
“Sorry Aria, knowing for sure now what you are, I do not think I can give you relief.  But I will not let you suffer anyway.  I have to meet Kalco shortly.  There is a promise I can’t forget to keep.”  She lifted her hand, energy starting to swirl by it.
“ ‘Promise…?’” Aria repeated, more to herself than to the monster before her.  “A Promise…”
Laina shook her head with a soft disgust, “Pathetic at the end.”
Something had awoken in her mind, triggered by her life being so close to the end.  Aria’s eyes focused with a new awareness.  Her left hand danced down her armor, hitting the shortest time delay on all the grenades on a belt.  She ripped off the belt and threw it right at Laina in a final desperation attack and fell face first into the snow before a bright light lit up the corner of the Reiko-10 base.

 
The Last Two Survivors
Day-3, Dusk
Location: Burning ruins of Reiko-10

Kalco took his right hand off his stomach for a moment, covered in warm blood.  “Heh, I’m the best…KACK!” he coughed loud, covering the front of the Lift-Bike in blood.  “I wouldn’t be killed by that.  Naturally.”  His eyes were heavy and his head started drifting forward.  He caught himself and shook awake before crashing the bike.  Any moment he would be back at Reiko-10, and someone there would be able to help him.  Or at least he could get to the medical lab, or find a Medi-kit.  Or…
His hope fell out of him much faster than the blood as he saw the ruined base.  The light on the bike was not needed as a major portion of the base was on fire, dark smoke spiraling into the darkness above.  A small dump of adrenaline took away the sleepiness as he rolled into the base.  The side of the ground vehicle bay was destroyed, bashed inwards with claw marks slashed deep into the metal.  He left the bike running and got off of it, but soon thought better and turned back to shut it down to not lure anyone to his location.
There was no getting out of here.  In some deep, impossible location he realized the hero was going to lose.  Even beyond the pain in his stomach, he could feel something itching inside him.  When he had been hit by that pane of energy, it was doing something to his body, to his very cell structure.
He lifted his glove again, seeing dark, dark red.  “God damn it.”
Kalco walked towards the main room where he once left Solide a stash of weapons.  Crouching under a crashed steel beam was far harder than it ever should have been for the strong soldier.  The stash was still generally there; some weapons remained but most of the grenades had been taken.
“Solide?”  Kalco asked.  As if to answer, to his right there was a loud crack as the steel beams fell down, blocking Gamma wing.  It was somewhat of a useless action by an angry god because the ripping flames made the desire to go down there nonexistent anyway.  “Solide!” he yelled again.  Solide was strong; there is no way he was killed.
The central room was filled with bodies, stacked high with obstacles and bore little resemblance to the open area it was only cycles ago.  He staggered across to Delta and leaned into the doorframe.  Strange sounds coming from far down the hall caused him to abandon calling for the man here.
Kalco was turning back to the main room when he noticed a dismembered arm gripping a weapon.  Looking closer he realized it looked like Solide’s custom shotgun ‘Claim Jumper’.  It didn’t take long to see the shattered body pinned up against the wall by the glass panes punched through the battle armor he had on.  Despite the man’s musculature and heavy armor, he looked like nothing more than a photograph pinned to the wall carelessly.
Killed by a True Form, but…  Kalco looked down and saw a noticeable trail of white blood starting approximately where he stood, leading back into the main room.  What the hell did it mean?  Someone else was alive, and either killed Solide, or at least came by to look at him.
He knew nothing about how the man died, but Kalco had the disturbing feeling that it was a slow process and that his arm was probably cut off early and the coup de grâce did not come until long after being pinned to the wall.  Given what looked like many marks of his boots on the ground, it suggested that he was trying to kick himself out of the position.
Damn, he was not fond of him, but he was one tough bastard.  To see him go out like this did not make Kalco feel good.  It reminded him how much he hated True Forms.
He walked out, following the white trail towards Beta Wing.  He took a couple more steps when his Psionics started screaming at him, but in his highly wounded state he did not pick up on them fast enough.
“Where were you, Kalco?”  His eyes snapped to the timid girl Aria who was slumped up against a wall, bunkered in from this angle and her large rifle pointing right at him.
His left hand slowly moved down to the Sledgehammer, of which she likely couldn’t see from her position.  “I could say the same thing, Aria.”  Her face looked haggard, the dancing shadows of the flames in the distance adding to the effect.
“Where is your group?  Madigan, Zaier…Feyria?”
“Don’t know.  Probably all dead.”
“I know how every person I was with died,” she said.  The statement could be interpreted a lot of different ways.
“So you were with everyone who died.  Convenient.  Where is Laina?”
Her simple answer hit him hard.  “I killed her.”
He had to restrain every neuron firing in his brain, telling him to pull his pistol and chance the shot.  “How could you have killed her, you bitch!?”
“She was a Death Angel, a true manifestation of these creatures around us.”  Kalco shaking his head was proof he did not believe her.  “Zaier told me that you killed Feyria.”  Aria did not mention the bloody ending she gave to Zaier for reasons most would find very lacking.
Kalco stood there silently.
“…Did you kill her?” she questioned.
“Yes.”
“Why?”
“She tried to kill me.  In retrospect it was clear she was trying to prevent me from getting into the ship or maybe seeing Zaier.  Probably sympathetic to the Death Angels, I’d seen it before, there is no reasoning with them when they lose their brain like that.  She realized she had to try to stop me.”
“From what?” Aria asked.
“From getting to Zaier or from saving everyone.”
Aria laughed once, a rare thing for her.  “How trite.”
“I could care less if you believe me.”
Aria lifted a hand and knocked away section of her bangs, making a flow of red blood visible down the side of her head.  “What if I told you I wanted to save everyone also?”
Kalco laughed at the bitch.  “I’d ask why everyone you were with is dead.”  A loud crash caused him to cringe.  Aria didn’t fire, and behind him a section of roof fell away.  The wind and the snow howled ferociously but the room was still getting hotter with the spreading fire.
They had little time left.  The base was gone, and the only vehicle remaining was the Lift-Bike, but he was too wounded to truly drive it.  And where would they go, on a planet that had been overran and killed?   “Why did you kill Laina?  Why is everyone here dead?”
“We tried to test our blood, but Laina wouldn’t take the blood draw.”
“Did you?”  Kalco quickly shot back.
“…no.”
Kalco smiled because this girl was only digging herself deeper.  He would wait for his chance and kill her.
“Railine thought…”
“Railine’s an idiot,” Kalco cut her off.
“No,” she said firmly.  “Everyone thought that, but I think he understood something no one else did.”  
Aria thought about own self not being Solarian, and if they knew that she was a combat android they would likely have turned on her simply due to paranoia.  She was glad in a way that Laina bailed on the test, so her own truth could stay hidden.  Not many knew that she could only attack ‘Solarians’ if she had been attacked first, like with Laina, or if her programming concluded they were not Solarian, as was the case with ‘Zaier’, who was no longer the man who made that promise and wore her necklace.  In a fitting irony, had circumstances been different, she would have been the single most trustworthy person here.  To Solarians anyway.
“You murderous bitch.”
Aria ignored it.  The key to this in her mind was that Kalco was ambivalent to Laina.  Laina clearly was a Death Angel but his desire for her could potentially be excused by his own ignorance…maybe.  What really sealed the deal was his admission of wanting to ‘get to Zaier’, another Death Angel.
Kalco would have never believed her that Railine died to a Death Angel, and that his dying attacks weakened it enough that her and Solide could kill it.  Or that Ryla died from unknown causes, but likely from Laina.  Or that Solide also died likely from Laina, but had weakened her enough that the entire grenade belt was enough to put her down.  Or that the event that started everything was Rox getting killed nearly as soon as they left by the now-dead Solide.  Solide, who was trigger-happy and paranoid, but in retrospect completely Solarian in a hostile environment.
The entire murder-mystery was wrapped up when Aria killed the alien Laina who Solide battled to an unknown but quite obvious weakened level.  All this was too little too late, but now she was the only survivor on base.  Kalco’s interwoven story of being involved in two confirmed Death Angels was enough in her mind that she knew what had to be done.  Having no one left alive with him was all too predictable.
“Zaier was a Death Angel.  You knew that, didn’t you?  Why did you want to see him?”
“No he wasn’t.  He left us to blow up an alien ship we found.”
“Yes he was, and you knew it!”
“He died, you stupid bitch!”
“Then what did you need to see him for!?”
“To see that he was dead!”
To Kalco this was all quite clear.  In his mind he knew what happened off Reiko-10: the four of them ran into a Death Angel on the alien ship where Zaier was wounded.  The ship was where Zaier and Feyria would stay behind to blow it up, as she did not want to leave him.  Kalco and Madigan left, going to the Sensor Anomaly, where among other things Madigan was lost and the V-Plane left idle.  Kalco was trapped without a pilot, falling asleep on the plane was later awoken by the V-Plane being summoned by Feyria who was still alive over at the ancient ship.
She always kept a Grav-Beacon with her and remote piloted the plane back to her, unknowingly with Kalco on-board; unfortunately that meant leaving Madigan in unknown status at the sensor anomaly.  Fortuitously, given what happened next, she had also programmed a return path into the V-Plane so that it would fly back to Reiko-10, even without her being alive.
The tunnel to the ship was unapproachable and the whole site was covered in mist.  Feyria claimed they had destroyed the ship, and the heavy fog suggested the ship had indeed been detonated.  Feyria might have simply lost it, or was being manipulated by the True Forms when she attacked him.  Zaier was dead, down the exploded tunnel.  Aria talking of meeting him was just another lie.
The real crime of this psycho girl in front of him was her list of murders.  The small group of survivors had been manipulated and executed by her.  Every single one, including Laina.
“I got nothing more to say to you, you bitch.  You killed Laina.”
“You are just as infected.  You let everyone die while you geared up.”
“Most of that shit is useless, guns and accessories that don’t work.”  He thought to the orange pistol that dead girl on Reiko-7 had that turned on but would not fire.
“Only pure of heart can use those tools…perhaps you aren’t tapped in to the reality matrix, Kalco.”
Her insult was too much.  He jerked his hand up, squeezing the trigger.  His aim was good, but her reflexes were faster.  No sooner had he fired at her, than a bullet from her rifle blew away part of his right shoulder.  He dropped out of sight and was happy he heard her gasp from his own quick shot.
His left hand grabbed his right shoulder where a portion of it had been blown off.  He scrambled backwards a few steps, falling over to his side.  As he fell, something slipped out of his pocket.  It was a blue injection pen, a ReNew Pak.  Feyria’s.
Realizing he had had it this whole time, he grabbed it with his left, stabbing the very valuable ReNew Pak into his upper chest.
The extremely advanced medical technology rapidly reconstructed his shoulder to a fighting condition, even if it did look odd that the battle armor had a hole blown through it revealing a perfect, toned shoulder.  Even the previous injury sustained at Reiko-7 was healed, though the itching had not gone away.
This bitch…  She was good and that was the only ReNew pak he had.  He should have saved some fucking grenades instead of leaving them for Solide…
“Why did you lie about Zaier being dead?” her voice came from across the room.
“He blew up the ship, you stupid bitch.  I came back to find Feyria huddling in the collapsed tunnel.”
“You idiot…did you actually check if this tunnel was collapsed?  The ship wasn’t blown up, it was warming up!  That was a ship to leave this planet, they needed it to get off!”
She turned the corner and he fired at her twice.  She cringed and fell, diving back from where she came.  She was tough.  Those rounds should have blown her apart, maybe that armor she had on was blocking most of the shots.
TINK TINK.  His eyes went wide as he saw a small circular object land on his side.  He rapidly whipped himself over the obstacle wall in time to avoid the grenade going off.  A quick glance showed she was no longer down this ‘hall’ of trash/barricades in this tense hunting game the two were involved in.
“Feyria sure had some big pistol holes through her,” she baited.
“I admit I killed her, unlike your kill count, you cold bitch.”
“I killed Zaier.  The ship was melting out of the ice.  I got the jump on him and even then it was barely enough.”
He saw her through a hole and fired at her, the round hitting her solid in the chest.  She flinched but nothing…damn what kind of armor did she have?  He dove out of the way as her powerful rifle tore apart the weak defenses.
But he was good.  With the ReNew pak coursing through him, his natural strength, his strong armor, and his pistol, he was more than ready.  Sure his custom pistol Aelishun would have been better, but the Sledgehammer was enough for this bitch.  Hearing Aria cough a few times, he knew he would win.  He heard her and popped up just enough to get a few shots off, hitting her in the face as she twisted down to the ground.  Perfect, that was the type of attack he could go finish her off with.
He waited just a bit, then crept over to where she would be.  With surprise he noticed she was far closer than he expected.  She got up and dove at him, both of them crashing across the floor, but he got up and still had the Sledgehammer.  In the grapple she had ripped some of the items off his belt, including that stupid toy the Reiko-7 girl had.
Aria looked nearly dead, her face bleeding very badly, but she was still able to express surprise as she held the orange weapon.  “You had…one of these?!”
“Doesn’t matter.  It’s a useless piece of shit.”  He elbowed her across the face, then pushed her off of him.
“It did not recognize your heart!” she practically pleaded with him.  She leveled the gun, and the stupid little colors swirled around.  Imagine his surprise when suddenly a volcano of energy exploded out blowing a portion of his body away as he fell to the floor in a slopping sound.  She could no longer stand and knelt before falling forward, spurting out white blood at a regular interval from a hole in her back.  “You weren’t a Death Angel after all…  You…were Solarian…?
“Ha…nah…not exactly…fuck… but…but you were an android?  Aren’t you supposed to protect us?”
“Heh…you shot…first…damn it…”  Aria was crying face down onto the metal.
“Fuck….”  Kalco put his one arm over his face, as if to hide the multitude of mistakes he had made as death was coming for him.

Together they were reaching the same conclusion in different ways.  Initially, the situation and circumstance the ‘other’ had in their eyes were too circumstantial that they had to be guilty.  Combat androids were bound by certain rules, of which Aria seemed to be the strict kind.  She would literally not have been capable of killing Laina or Zaier if either had not attacked her first, or if they were not Solarian or Solarian allies.  Her programming regarding Zaier had been met as he was no longer a Solarian as he did not remember the promise they shared, as it so happened he was similar to Laina.  Aria was just an android caught in a situation far beyond anything she might be able to process or understand.  Circumstantially she looked like a murderer, but in the end that thought was way wrong.
To Aria it was obvious as she was dying here that Kalco was good at heart, if not utterly foolish and misguided.  He sincerely believed Zaier would blow up the ship, but apparently was a Death Angel and manipulated Feyria.  Kalco didn’t think that Zaier would be alive deeper in that melting tunnel, readying the ship to leave.  The idea that he killed Feyria for attacking him, and that Madigan was killed by a Death Angel all made sense.  The fact that Aria wasn’t blown apart or impaled by Kalco-Death Angel showed his innocence despite his involvement with Laina before this all happened.
Such bad circumstances as viewed from the other side.  They were fooled by nearly everything else as the fire around them raged.
Aria crawled a bit towards Kalco, wanting to touch him as she lifted her arm towards him.  Kalco’s one arm pulled him two steps closer but the blood loss was too much.  He felt the N-Limit coming for him.  They looked at each other’s eyes, reflections of the fire sparking in the back.  Their hands were so close, and they stretched and stretched before the effort was too much and both their hands fell to the ground in a final defeat.
How did it end this way?
Tears were coming to the proud Kalco’s face as his life was leaving him.  So many battles and victories, only to die somewhere pointless like this, blown away by a combat android of all things.  The sole survivor of a previous encounter and now so thoroughly routed.
Aria’s own eyes were watering.  Despite being an android there were not many differences anymore, and her feelings were just as real given she was created from an actual biologic woman in her past.  She replayed scenes of her past, the love she felt for Zaier once, and the irony of having to kill him.  Her systems began shutting down as she looked at Kalco.  He may have delivered the final blow but the situation was hopeless a while back mostly from the fight with Laina.  She let out a painful yipe as she gritted her teeth and closed her eyes in intense pain.  She was so scared of dying.  Her reservoir had run out of fluid, and there was a grinding sound that was burning deep in her.  Androids felt fear, they were just as scared of dying, their organic brain parts just as real.  She didn’t want to die!  There were so many things she wanted to see…
Tears were falling off his face.  Seeing the girl cringe and cry in pain only made his own death worse.  He looked at the flames all around him, recalling Laina’s smile and laughs.  Once when they were running through a field…another when she popped out behind a corn row to scare him…
Laina…

 
Rox
Day-4, Morning
Location: Reiko-10, Destroyed Delta Wing

Rox was sad regarding her situation but given the sacrifice others had made, she would never ask for any sort of pity.  
Looking at Solide stapled to the wall by her enemies filled her with a grim determination for the task she must do.  She cared less about that man, finding him crude, insolent, and far too ignorant of deeper matters.  The worst part was she knew how things would play out, and knew the very annoying likelihood of him being the first awoken.  He was utterly incapable of providing any likely way out, and it made the irony even more bitter that she would have to likely have to come to sympathize with someone who was so quick to blow her away.  Regardless, her short distraction on him was hardly worth the even sadder events that unfolded in front of her with the two last survivors.
She walked into the room where Aria and Kalco had battled to their death, ironic given their actual roles.  It hurt Rox seeing their hands reaching for the other, where they died in their final spot.
The way things had played out here was not promising.  This was going to take a very long time.  There were so many variables that occurred, so many ways things that needed to go right and did not.  She walked over to the wall, sitting down, and feeling a tear in her eye over the raw emotionality of Aria and Kalco’s final moments.  The entire events here were definitely implanting onto the Emotional Field, and this final emotion of the two of them was practically readable as it hung in the air.
She sighed, resting her lowered head on her knees.  A moment later a snout was nudging her.  She lifted her face, seeing a battered dog, Ricochet, there.  “You’re still alive!”  She grabbed it and gave it a tight hug.  It yipped and she let it go, seeing a deep slash down its side.  “Poor boy, I bet you’re the only one left.  I’m sure you find this so confusing.  I know what is going on, and I’m still confused by how it played out.  So close on some, but so far on others.”
The heat was getting too hot to handle; little was left of the base at this point.
She pet the dog absent-mindedly, the poor thing itself too wounded to really do much and was simply glad for any ‘Solarian’ contact.  “Poor, poor boy.”  She scratched his ears, and he liked it even if the whine had a twinge of pain in it.  Rox frowned seeing the blood on her hand.
Outside the sunlight had begun to rise.  Normally it was such a happy sight, but here it only compounded the sadness as it cast illumination on the desolation and hopelessness.  It would not take until midday for the only things remaining to be some burnt out ashes and smoke spiraling into the atmosphere.  Untold would the trials here forever be.
Rox lifted her hand, feeling the very tense Emotional Field writing that had just occurred.  “So sad this lesson is at the end of such a dark, bloody path.”  Rox had an understanding here no one else came close to, and what she saw made her start to cry.  Her sobs were barely audible among the roar of the flames before the base had completely burnt down and the last of the heat on Reiko was whipped away in the cold icy wind.

Railine
Day-1, Morning
Location: Reiko-10 Base

Railine had attempted many visions quests in his life to tap into his subconscious for guidance on his life.  Though he was standing around others who were arguing and afraid about what was happening, his head started swimming.  He was seeing something, and thought it was a vision quest erupting across his mind.
Railine had devoted much of his life to esoteric pursuits.  It was in contrast to his appearance of his large frame and his fire-scarred face which made him look animalistic.  While running or lifting weights his mind was often on recent philosophy ideas he had read about.  Stoicism was a major ideal he followed but was not above believing in a type of mysticism.  
This was beyond the normal spirituality most followed of the Line.  He had felt there was a deeper truth that others could understand if they only dug a little further.  It was somewhat ironic of course that he was good friends with Madigan, someone so anti-spiritual or against ‘magical’ thinking in the least.  There were those types of course, as rare as they were, who didn’t want to accept even any of the more base parts of the Line.  Feyria was another one.  But it was hardly a concern of Railine if they didn’t want to see the truth.
Railine had felt déjà vu in the past.  Most people had, but he had long thought it was strange to remember something he had not actually lived.  It was often simple things like standing at a corner of a street as a hovercar lands to let someone out, something an average person would discount as merely ‘typical’, despite a clarity he had not actually previously experienced this.  Other things as well, like when he used to kayak rivers, there was a subtle sensation of knowing when a harsh or scary part was coming up.  He attributed it, – after many retrospective mediations – to a somewhat unscientific ‘tainting’ of feelings into the environment by others before him.
The area where he really noticed it was rock climbing.  It was a friend that pointed it out first even though he had felt it.  “I could feel your fear at the one crack, right where it starts to overhang.”  They would laugh about it, and it became a joke of sorts about how they could sense each other’s fear or ‘insanity’ at certain fearful areas of a climb.  It started as a pure funny coincidence, but there was something to it; after all why should there be any feeling or sensation of another’s feelings at all?  
Something like that proved to actually be a pretty big thing to Railine that he never let go after he actually started accepting that there may have been something to it.  If something super intense could be sensed by others, what did it mean?  He wasn’t sure, other than that by allowing himself to actually explore down that thought path, there seemed to more and more evidence of it.  
His home world of Lania Prime – the medic Laina, of whom he had a rivalry of sorts, had a disturbingly similar name - was a green mountainous world, and in nearly every way an antithesis to the endless frozen wastes of Reiko beyond that they both had snow.  Lania was an earlier colony that was still connected to Terra, unlike some of the absolute earliest settlements that got abandoned and fell behind on tech development.
Like many of the early colonies, the ones that did not voluntarily convert to the new dominate Terran culture (under heavy Aelisha influence) were grandfathered in to not be forced to assimilate.  Their own unique cultures were allowed to exist, but still retained the standard benefits of Affiliated protection.
What it really came down to was that Lania Prime sent sufficient tax money and manpower to the Solarian Federation, so they in the end did not care what some early colonial planet still practiced.  In a hostile universe, policing one’s own race was a low priority when a colony mostly was supportive.
Lania Prime was in a strange balance like many of the early colonies.  They still possessed modern technology, like Railine was indeed given up-to-date nanites.  One of the biggest differences though was the fact he was born.  A ‘Birther’ as so many would insult him.
Another example perhaps more reminiscent of the older ‘Earth’ culture, was the burying of their dead.  It actually was once an issue of religious debate as to whether a body was impeded in returning to the Line if it was buried rather than destroyed some other way, the people on his planet came down on the ‘No’ side.
There was a vast graveyard he lived fairly close to, the graveyard of the original colony many, many generations ago.  It was a large, well maintained and honorable location with soft rolling hills and grand old trees shading the endless grass and grave stones.  Anyone there could feel it.  There was a quiet, serene energy to the place, a sort of prestige and tranquility that had struck him ever since he was a kid.
His younger sister was buried there because they had direct lineage to the original colonists and he would go often to visit her.  She had died mostly due to the inaction of his parents.  He still bore much anger in his young heart at them for letting her die.  Even through that aspect that certainly blinded him to some extent spiritually, he could feel the aura of calmness about the place.
For a long time he attributed the feeling to the Life energy simply returning to the Line.  Certainly there was a large element of that.  Later when his mind started thinking about his rock climbing or kayaking experiences there seemed to be a connection as there was a similar but different thing going on.  For kayaking he could attribute the feeling initially to Life energy all the rivers, water, plants, and mountains had.  Initially.  But there were always those times, right before serious action or waterfalls.  It was most clear with climbing though; it was a feeling of fear.  The feeling was tangible, and not even his, because he would feel it even on belay and had near zero chance of injury; he was feeling prior people’s emotions tangibly.
The very strange feeling that was a little like dizziness still hung over his consciousness.  It was like he was sensing other’s feelings around him.  Railine laughed in his mind.  Where was Madigan to dismiss these things completely?
His mild entertainment was only short lived as the entire event he found himself in was very dire.  He had these thoughts about déjà vu and being aware of feelings because in front of him were half of the already vastly reduced group of the Reiko-10 base and he felt the same dark feelings of intense emotions.  There was no reason he should have, because he had been in this room hundreds of times and never felt it before.  Even with the recent circumstances of coming back from the mysteriously destroyed Reiko-7 the slight panic everyone felt was overt – unlike this subtle background he was referring to.
What was going on here?  Something had changed, something had occurred in this room.  But what was it?  Did something occur after they left to Reiko-7 with the rest of the crew?
Railine looked around.  Solide looked poised and angry, young little Ryla looked worried, Aria was unreadable, Laina looked stone-faced, and last left was Rox.  Rox was facing the other way, but as Railine was looking at her, she turned around to, of all things, give him a wink and a knowing smile.
“Uhh…”  Railine was hit by a wave of nausea; something seemed oddly familiar in what was happening here.  A bad dream occurred.  Why would he have thought of something random like this?  He was sure Rox was shot, killed somehow, but she was fine, maybe even flirting with him.  He did not engage in sexual activities much due mostly to his introversion, but looking down at her large legs, maybe he might resurrect that part of him.
‘What?’  He hardly had any time to think how strange the action was and how she knew he was looking at her when the next moment blew those thoughts away almost as strongly as Rox’s face was blown away.
*Boom!*
The shock hit everyone around them twice.  One was the physical shockwave of a weapon being fired; the second was the emotional shock of being betrayed.  It took a few moments for the physical reactions to kick in, which was coincidentally as long as it took for Rox’s body to react, as it was still standing with the right side of her face missing.  Solide wasted zero time pumping another shell through her body, exploding flesh into the back wall that sent her body down.
“No…way…”  Railine stood stunned, the axe he had brought back from Reiko-7 ready to go as the blood from Rox’s body was slowly dripping onto the floor.  His mind was reeling, trying to process a cacophony of various inputs: REPEAT, SHOT, ROX, DEAD, BLOOD, SOLIDE, DEATH, LIFE, ESCAPE, SAFETY.  Everyone slowly started realizing that Rox had been killed in a remorseless and calculated attack.
This was playing out nearly how his dream had, the details coming back to him.  Random details like the blood dripping off his axe, his own words that naturally came out.  He remembered thinking this is what happened at Reiko-7, but was it him remembering that, or him remembering a dream where he thought that?
“Rox!  Noooo!” Ryla screamed, falling to her knees.  The dogs all started barking wildly, they were smart enough to not approach Solide as they could sense his readiness to shoot.
In near perfect reaction Aria fell to the ground, swinging her rifle around and sighting it directly onto Solide’s chest.  His weapon was powerful, but so was hers.  It would explode apart his body and the slug would travel through the wall before ending in some snow dune a long distance outside.
He knew his reaction, it was just like the dream coming back to him.  “Solide!” he yelled, holding the axe in a grip in front of him.  Laina had brandished her Nano-Blade and the three of them faced him.  Laina dashed forward to go Rox’s bleeding out body.
This was happening exactly how this vague dream played out.  Solide said something and she stopped.
“Not so fast there, bitch,” Solide warned as he pointed at her with the gun.  “You take one more step and you are going to be joining her.  I’ve really hated your fucking face from the beginning and I’ve been looking for a reason to rearrange it.”
“What are you doing!?” Laina shouted; she was the type to never swear, unlike Solide’s endless stream.
“What have you done?” Railine demanded.
“Solide, whyyyy!?” Ryla sobbed.  The dogs barked and growled loudly but did not get close.
“Are you going to let me talk?” Solide asked.  No one said anything because Laina was the most extroverted of the ones alive and she was likely too busy wondering if she should chance him shooting her.  “Shut those fucking dogs up before I shoot them!”
As if watching a movie he responded automatically.
“Hey,” he walked over, grabbing the dogs and shaking them a bit, .  “It’s okay, calm down.  It’s okay…Rhett, hey boy, calm down.”  It seemed like when he called the dog by its name it seemed to have calmed down like he remembered.
Solide laughed.  “We are in a bad situation boys and girls, and little Ms. Doggy over there is a traitor in our midst.”
The shock of this dream coming to pass hit him hard enough that he thought he was supposed to say something, but did not.  The scene changed slightly but eventually seemed to be back where it was.
“We are fighting an enemy that you cannot possibly comprehend.  An enemy that makes you question what you know, and whom you trust.  You think that fucking creature I laid out earlier is anything!?  That’s our true enemies’ PAWNS.  This whole fucking planet is likely infested and over-ran.  Clearly I am not the only Solarian left here or you all would turn Death Angel on me and rape me out.  Yet with how bold the dog bitch was, it makes me think one or more of you are Death Angels already.”  Solide had stopped, it seemed like Railine was supposed to say something but eventually Solide continued.  “We were placed on this planet as a trap to see what happens, to see if we can win against these fucking things.  Obviously the answer is no, as Seven found out, and all the other bases apparently. You fuckers are so behind the curve here, I feel bad for how stupid you are.”
Solide seemed to think he knew something, and Railine felt the pull to ask him.  “Can we talk about this?”  It was like a video he was in and could not stop.  He knew the next line: Let me save Rox.
“Let me save Rox,” Laina begged as she took one step closer.
“Rest assured there, lovely lady, that our dear friend Rox is quite dead.  If you kill the angels while they’re in this form it’s harder for them to come back.”
Laina looked menacingly at him, “Don’t you call me that.”
“What?  No ‘asshole’ or ‘fucker’?”  Solide grinned darkly in a scary smile as he showed all his teeth.  “Try it.  Sometime it becomes addicting.”  
“Evidently so does murder, you psycho.”  Laina turned her face away from looking at Rox who, unlike the alien body, had more than enough blood splattered and was bleeding out across the room.
“See if you like when I talk to you like this better: one step more and you’re gone bitch,” Solide said to the wary medic.
His next line came out of him nearly without control, the movie disturbingly now in motion.  “Traitor to what!?” Railine asked trying to figure out what was happening.
“To life.”
Maybe Railine could kill him, but he needed to get behind him…This vision perhaps was a sign for him to try to kill Solide.
The confusion continued as the movie played out in front of him.  He had seen all of this before in some vague capacity.  He recalled it as it happened, but could not remember what came before in any significant ability.
“I liked you Solide, why are you like this?” Ryla asked between her tears.
“She found something at Seven.  Saw her pick up what looked like a weapon and pocketed it silently.  It didn’t sit well with me, and now that I am back here with everyone dead, it’s obvious where her loyalties lie.”  
“What the hell kind of logic is that!?” Railine yelled in a rare obscenity from him, he remembered how weird it felt in the dream, too.
Solide looked angry.  “You don’t get it.  I’d seen this shit before.  Once we were at Seven it was clicking why the fuck I was here.  No one else should have known…but Rox did.  It was suspicious enough, but why would she think to do something like that?”
“You idiot!  What do you think I got this axe from?”  Railine hardly processed that, to a psycho like Solide maybe that was reason he should shoot Railine as well.
Closing his eyes he softly laughed to himself.  “So simple-minded.  You grabbed that axe for protection from the big bad monsters around you.”
“And what did she do!?”
“You had the axe is plain view, just like Madigan had some weapon also; you were not hiding it from us.  Further, I watched that whore’s face close when we got back, she showed no sign of surprise when we were the only ones left here.  She knew…the bitch.”  
Railine considered himself a student of logic, and such a perversion of thought process was tough to endure especially when lives were being sacrificed on the altar.  “Unbelievable.”
Laina frowned.  “I never liked you, and this completely proves how right I was.  Are you going to put your gun down?  You can’t take all of us.”
Solide started laughing.  “You are way wrong there, bitch.”  He turned to Ryla.  “I am only going to tell you once, Ryla, come with me if you want to live.”  She was sniffling hard, wiping her tears, confused about what he was asking.  “One of these other four is a Death Angel.  I’m sure there was at least one with the other group too, so I have no doubt they’re probably wiped out by now.”
What was he talking about?  Solide always seemed unfriendly, but now being completely crazy at a inopportune time like this was very, very bad.
“Don’t you dare go with him,” Laina said.
“He’s crazy, Ryla,” Railine agreed.  Aria stayed silent, having her preference of Ryla staying with them, but said nothing and kept her finger ready over the trigger.  She suspected Solide might be fast enough to shoot twice, but only at the two standing, he would certainly be dead after that.
Solide lowered his shotgun, closing his eyes.  “None of you guys have a clue what is going on here.  Ol’ Kalco’s the only other one that might have an idea.  Even if he knows, they are probably all dead already, or,” he paused for a moment, “sometimes they play fucked up games and pick you off one at a time to increase the fear.  Pure guess it’s that slutty pilot, Feyloose or whatever the fuck her dumb name is.  It’s always the type you don’t expect, and usually female.”
He started walking away before he continued.  “Watch shy sniper bitch, she was alone at Reiko-7.  Though, hell she could’ve been one even before that!”  He started laughing loudly.  “I could be surrounded by these things…maybe us Solarians are outnumbered already!”
What was vastly disturbing to Railine was on some level he had seen this before but was stuck to merely watch it all unfold as his reactions were apparently deeply engrained.
“Why are you doing this!?”  Laina yelled at him.  “Answer us!”
He looked over his shoulder at her with an incredulous look.  “Fuck you.”  He turned and walked away.  No one made a motion at first until it was broken by Laina dashing to Rox.
In the dream Railine naturally ran over to get a Medi-kit; it was the obvious course of action, but right now he just stood there.  He was trying to comprehend what was happening from his strange dream as only parts of it were recalled.
He saw visions of doing an emergency surgery under the guidance of Laina and they attempted to reconstruct Rox’s organs.  It was an involved process, one which he was trying to recall when suddenly the movie came to a screeching halt.
“She is dead,” Laina said as she stood up.  This seemed very different, unlike the near clone of the prior events.  Was it because Railine did something as simple as not go get the kit?  It was as if the auto-play of the movie was now off.
 “I’ll get a Res Kit,” he offered.  Loosely he wondered what happened to someone’s Life energy or soul when this occurred; had it not actually Departed yet?  Laina reached out and grabbed his hand, shaking her head no.
“Why?  There’s a chance!  The kit will restart a normal functioning nanite cycle and we stopped the N-Limit, most of her body is in good shape.  I’ve seen worse come back.”
Laina said in a very cold manner, “No you haven’t.”
Railine denied it, “No one time, this guy…”
Laina stood up, almost tears in her eyes.  “No you fucking haven’t!”  The profanity hung in the room due to its rarity, unlike Solide’s every other word preference.  “She was dead and on the verge of N-Limiting, you don’t come back from both!”  She turned her head to the side, wiping tears away.  “Fuck…not again…”
Something rubbed Railine wrong about that line as well.  Laina said that Rox was N-Limiting like she had last time, but that was when they were dong advanced surgery on her.  How could Laina have made that conclusion so quickly this time?
Aria was still silently kneeling as Ryla stood up and ran over, grabbing onto Railine and hugging him, making it rather obvious how young she was amidst the older people around her.  He started to move his hands away from her as if they were bloody, but for some reason they were not and was confused at this fact. Her actions reminded Railine of a painful past of a sister he lost and held her tightly in return using just his elbows.  There was no way to get back what he lost; he had vainly tried that path for a while.  All he could do now was comfort this simple girl way over her head.  Railine also felt over his head and he had seen a lot more dead people in his life then this young girl softly whimpering into his body.
This part really confused Railine.  As he knew for sure this reminded him of his dead sister, and the certainty of that was blurred with the strange sensation of an eerie dream and the psuedo-déjà vu happening.
For a long time the room hung in a silence punctuated only by Laina’s sniffles and Ryla’s soft crying.  Aria stood up, making a small circle with her left hand and nodding at Rox’s body before respectfully stepping away.  
Aria stood up, lifting her left arm straight above her head, her right pointed at the ground.  She swung each in an opposite arc until they were pointing down and up respectively before pulling together in front of her chest, nodding at Rox’s body before respectfully stepping away.
That was the Star Priestess departed prayer; he remembered her doing that in the dream too, only her hands were bloody in that one.
Slowly the frequency of the other two women’s sounds died down.
He remembered asking a stupid question no one would know the answer about Solide’s motivations, and with some degree of willpower remained silent.  Again, the vision was unhinged slightly from how it was supposed to be occurring, but soon enough it was back on track when he heard a sound that made his stomach tighten.
The dogs started growling as they all turned and formed a line towards one of the doors outside.  His voice trailed off as his eyes processed a figure in the room at the weapon locker.  The other’s slowly turned to look.  He remembered something about this as well, it had to do with a fight.
As if the very act of being noticed triggered it, the being came dashing at them.  The figure reared a huge blade from its right side before swinging it at Railine who, by pure reflex and with an extra moment of preparation because he had seen this before, blocked the attack solidly, thereby sparing Ryla next to him.
He shoved forward, and for its small frame it resisted his strength well, but he was large and powerful and crushed it backwards.  Laina had slashed at the creature being pushed back.  The slash seemed worthless as the enemy showed no signs of pain.  A dog jumped up, biting the arm of the thing and dragging it closer to the ground.  There was an explosion of Aria’s rifle at the same time but it missed due to the dog pulling the creature out of the line.  Railine pulled back rapidly and slashed the large axe, cleaving the creature apart and causing a splash of blue blood to fly upwards.  It acted like liquid for a moment before turning to a gas and disappearing away.
This was slightly different.  He slashed again at the corpse, mincing it a few times to be sure it was in fact dead.
He was breathing hard, seeing a new blue color dripping down his axe rather than the human red.  It was a dream, a dream to warn him about this attack.  It was a premonition.  Maybe he had a Chrono Psionic and this is how the manifested; only he did not understand the meaning of it until it was too late and Rox was dead.
“This is just like Seven,” Ryla was saying, something was different this time. 
Things had played out differently.  They did not take nearly the same damage.  Excluding Ryla who got pushed down, no one else was touched at all.
“This one looks like a girl also…” Aria said, staring down at the body.  
The thin feminine frame was nearly as strong as Railine.  It looked like a human that had been mutated or merged with some sort of monster and Daijin Star.  The broken metal wing rods lay shattered about its body.  Its large claw arm was cut apart from the battle and its pupil-less eye stared blankly at the wall.
He remembered a line coming that increased tension in the room, and it started coming from Laina.  “Long hair, sorrowful face…  You know…it sort of looks like…” Laina said right as Railine cut her off.
“We aren’t sure what it looks like yet,” Railine said firmly.  She looked confused about being cut off.
Railine looked at the face a bit more, noticing it was definitely the same as his vague vision.  The blank eye staring out, the facial tattoos etched on one side, almost like part of its face was falling off or changing into something…it made him wary.  In a very short time his friend Rox was murdered, and a humanoid creature attacked them, both their bodies in pools of fluid on the ground.  He really wanted a flamethrower, but against the fate he felt like he was fighting, it did not seem close to sufficient.
One of the dogs went over to Laina and started growling.  Railine grabbed the dog and pulled him away.  His actions were slowly piling up and the movie was becoming more and more vague. There was something about testing the creature’s blood, but could not remember exactly.  He was not sure what the entire point of the vision was, but knew in his heart one thing for sure about Laina.
Railine considered dropping what he knew to be true, and hesitated for a moment.  This wasn’t like the movie exactly anymore; he was off the path enough that he was not sure if he could continue.  Seeing her stare at him rubbed him the wrong way and fired at her, “You let Rox die.”
The words silenced the room.  Laina’s mouth hung open slightly.
“What…did you say to me?”  The woman squared up to Railine.  Aria, Ryla, and even the dogs faded to the side as the atmosphere of the two of them had turned hostile
Railine had committed to this fate he had chosen; it was now different than the vision he had.  The previous one didn’t end well somewhere down the line, of that he was sure.
“You called Rox too fast.”
“And what do you know, you stupid ape?”
“You didn’t even try anything.”
“A majority of her brain was missing.  Not even crafting temporary tissue could have saved her.”
“We could have used a Res Kit on her!” he shouted at the woman he was obviously much stronger than, but in terms of medicine it was night and day the other way; this irony was not lost on her in the slightest.
She shook her head, her shoulder-length hair with its single wisp near her front bangs matched her head’s movement.  “This is so unbelievably ridiculous.  To even question me fills me with such a hatred for your ignorance and presumptuousness.”
Railine looked to Aria.  “I hate to drag you in, but you know it was true, don’t you?”
Aria did not meet anyone’s eyes, and eventually admitted, “She was not yet Departed…as the Star Priestesses say.”
Laina laughed dismissively.  “I could care less what an idiot and a killer believe.  Her face was gone, and you are questioning me?  You know nothing compared to me.”
“Why did you let her die!?”  Railine shouted to her, choking up on his axe.
“Don’t you dare act hostile to me,” she shouted pridefully back as she lifted her Nano-Blade towards him.  “As a combat medic I’ll test my skills against a damage control ape anytime!”
“Stop it!” Ryla yelled as she began to cry again.
She tried a new avenue of argument with him.  “You are picking way wrong if you are taking Aria’s side,” Laina said to Railine, somewhat calm but with a distinctly elevated voice.  “That last creature looked like her, what more do you need!?  Aria is one of those monsters, how fucking dense are you!?”
Railine faltered for a moment, looking to the side at the hacked up being; its sad look was very similar to Aria.
Aria had walked up to Laina in an odd level of boldness for the shy woman.  “Your behavior calls for your termination so that those I serve may continue safely.  If you would be so kind as to slap me.”  Railine looked confused, and Laina looked a bit as well.  She then added, “You useless medical bitch.”  The word and especially the phrase seemed way out of place for Aria but it angered Laina enough that she agreed and struck Aria hard across the face.
Aria turned back with a rare smile.  “Thank you.”  She stepped back, rolled her large rifle out in front of her and point blank shot Laina in the chest.  She cycled the action and put another one through the collapsed body’s head on the floor.  The large caliber rifle left little of Laina, much like Solide left little of Rox.
“Ahhh!”  Ryla was screaming and Railine was once again shocked after thinking he understood what was happening here.  The dream was going way wrong.  It was a good warning at the time but now real life was spiraling out of control.
The stupidity of thinking he saw the future was blasted out of his mind as Laina was blasted apart on the ground in front of him.  He lifted his head, wearing a look of shock that he could not control.  He watched speechlessly as Aria casually slung her rifle back onto her back, as if gunning someone down at point blank with a sniper rifle was normal.  But in this nightmare on Reiko, maybe it was all too normal.

 

Ryla
Day-1, Midday
Location: Reiko-10 Bunkered room

Ryla’s eyes were wide.  She had felt something in the Emotion Field, but it was vague, a single strong pulse but nothing to pin down.  Laina dead on the ground was not the reason, right?
“Wha…What?”  Railine staggered backwards.
“She had become a danger to us all.” Aria spoke softly.  It blew Ryla away she could be so calm after a second murder occurred in a very short period of time.
“God…why….” Ryla’s voice moaned.  Maybe it was ‘betrayal’ she felt in the EF.
“Aria, I thought…we were friends.”
Aria looked back at him, her sad face frowning to a level much more melancholic than typical.  “We are.  That is why I did it.”
“Are you…?”
“I understand your concern, but I have zero interest in attacking you.  In my mind, loyalty is a very unalterable thing.  I value myself, and I value those around me.  She threatened that.”
Railine tensed up.  Ryla trusted him much more than the silent sniper girl.  Ryla had dashed up to him, hugging his large body again.  “Can you save her?”  It felt comforting to hug a large, strong man like him.
He looked to Aria and many things passed through their glance.  Ryla knew the sniper was more skilled than him when it came to medical knowledge, so it would be her move way more than his.  She did just shoot Laina, so would she really try to save her?  He didn’t like Laina, especially the way she recently acted, but to just let her die?
“Save her!” Ryla yelled as she pushed herself off of him.
Her body was unmoving.  It was only the immense combination of modern medical technology, superior engineered genetics, a healthy lifestyle, and nanites that a body blown apart by two large caliber sniper bullets was even feasible to be saved.
“I can’t let her just die,” he said to Aria with a poise in his voice.
“She is quite dead,” she said back.
Railine awkwardly stepped over Laina’s arm that still held her Nano-Blade and inspected the body.  The perfect shot at the heart and the following one into the brain darkly reminded Railine that his shy friend Aria was a hardened killer.  He plunged two fingers into the gape of her chest, the remainder of the heart was not moving in the slightest.  He felt around for any evidence of an N-Limit to suggest she was beyond saving if they did not act fast.
Not everyone who died N-Limited of course, it was actually really rare and usually only a result of extreme trauma.  When it triggered, it was a pretty violent way to go, and if it happened more often the populace would likely reconsider having millions of tiny machines in their body that, at certain triggers near death, would eat them alive in a vain attempt to save them.  It was an odd side effect of the nanites, the so called ‘death spiral’ where they interpreted a near-fatal condition as such an emergency they go into overdrive replicating to help the injury, that the very act of replication became a stressor eventually leading to death.
“I am not sure why there is no nanite activity, if any injury was the type that would trigger an N-Limit, this was the type of injury it would be expected.”  Railine’s confused face suggested this fact felt wrong there was no evidence of it, but he could not place why.
Ryla tried to remember her lineage to hold some semblance of strength, but she was never good with gore around her.  “Railine, can’t you use a Res Kit on her like you suggested about Rox?” she asked.
The question fell on deaf ears because he was legitimately confused as to what he was looking at.  He glanced over at Rox’s body and it only added to the mystery as to what he was thinking.
Like a zombie, he stood up, his hand still bloody from Laina, and walked over to Rox.  He knelt down next to her also and did a couple of quick over-views of signs of life in the post-nanite age.  Pulling out his hand, his overlaid a magnifier lens of nanites over his eyes, looking closely at Rox’s blood.
At least as far as Ryla could tell from here, it was very red and very still.  That last part about the blood not moving was key to the conventional understanding of ‘death’, but as Railine continued looking back to the body, Ryla was no longer sure if the blood in fact was ‘unmoving’.
Railine took another sample on his hand, and was deeply disturbed by whatever it was.  He shook his head very slowly, almost as if ‘no’ was something he could will into the universe to deny what he was finding.  What did it mean that both of them were so atypical?  Did Solide and Aria know something when they committed their dark deeds?  
“Railine?” Ryla meekly asked.
He was looking at his bloody hand.  To the others it probably looked much more psychotic than it really was.
“Aria, forgive perhaps this basic question, but true death is when they are ‘dead’ and they also have nanite shutdown, correct?”
“Of course.”
Ryla was hopeful.  “Are they not dead?”
“I shot to kill, Laina is dead,” Aria said in a way that utterly lacked tact.
Railine shook his hand of excess liquid, then wiped it on his jacket, which slowly started absorbing the blood and cleaned itself off.  “No, they both had nanite shutdown.”
“Then they are dead?  How can you tell!?  They are ¬nano-sized, you couldn’t just see that!” Ryla yelled desperately.  “Don’t they make some androids out of dead people!?  I have definitely heard of that…”  The Solarians did that occasionally with some of the best samples they had, she knew that.
“The technology required for that is very advanced,” Aria said, thinking it would offer comfort but only displayed her general lack of social grace.
Railine did not say anything to her.
A single nanite was not visible, but in liminal death stages nanites were active and congregated at areas like the heart or brain stem, and a mass of them were visible under magnification as slightly undulating blood.  When a person was dead, the nanites knew before anything else and silently shut down, barring the rare N-Limit where the person is consumed, so there should be no movement in a tissue or blood sample.  It should be as silent, cold, and unmoving as the body it was taken from.
Should.
Railine looked back at Laina’s body, and Ryla could tell he felt the same thing she did.  Something wasn’t right.  Aria claimed to have shot to kill, but Ryla did not think she actually might have been dead.  Railine’s actions aligned with her own feelings as there was something wrong occurring but he could not point to what it was.  Her feeling was purely intuition, but it was also mixed with a ‘betrayal’ element currently present in the Emotion Field.  Maybe this was an elaborate trap of some sort.
She really wanted to ask Aria about what Railine was seeing, given she had the best medical knowledge now of those alive, but could not truly trust her after the display of violence.  Aria claimed she would protect Railine but now Ryla no longer knew if this was true if he kept up his search of the bodies.  Aria was the reason Laina was on the ground in front of them and showed zero remorse of this fact.
Railine kept giving glances back to the body, clearly suppressing his desire to go back over there.  He definitely saw something, but now if he acted on it, it would alert Aria who was perhaps not supposed to know.
How could they get Aria out of here?
Unfortunately the wrong distraction came.
“Well, what a fucking party I missed.”
“Solide!” Ryla yelled, sounding like she missed him more than she probably should have.  She went to take a step then stopped.  She had a bad feeling about him too.  The only one here she trusted was Railine who was acting very carefully himself.
Railine lifted his axe and Aria held her rifle at the man.
“The fuck is this?”  He lifted both his empty hands.  His shotgun was strapped on his back, but obviously unarmed.  “I leave, med bitch gets plugged, and you guys want to shoot me?  You don’t think I did this, do you?”
Aria answered.  “I did.  She was a threat to Solarians.”
He laughed.  “I knew you had a cold heart.  But I didn’t come back to be your fucking friend and have some tea time, these fucks are closing in on the base.  I picked a few of them out of the storm, but there are tons, so we got some major problems but we got some shit we need to take care of first.”
Ryla’s Psionics told her she was safe from Solide, for now.  That last part was a necessary qualifier as she could tell at some point he definitely might make a murderous move on her.  The selfishness in his heart did not need a Psionic to see.
Ugh…she looked back at the bodies of Rox and Laina.  She did not know that much about Solarian biology as it was not one of her strengths, but could she see anything if she got close?  Her Psionics subtly told her that something was afoot and Railine knew too on some level.  Her Psionics hummed in tune, giving her a sense of danger that should not exist from a dead body.
She needed to get alone with him, but with murderous Aria and psycho Solide both near them it was not looking good.  Both had the crazy ‘don’t leave I’m protecting you’ delusion that either might shoot if she tried to pull Railine away.
The Inter-Connect System was about the only thing she could do.
Railine, I…don’t think Laina is actually dead. – Ryla sent on a private message only to him.  
I don’t think so either.  I really want to take a close look, but I don’t think that opportunity will present itself. – Railine responded on the ICS.
Do you think Aria rigged this ‘death’ with Laina?  Ugh…the only person I trust right now is you. – Ryla
Just stay close to me, we will figure something out. – Railine said, turning to walk away.
I’ll watch your back as much as I can.  Maybe we can make it through this. – Ryla
Maybe.  I had a dream really similar to this. – Railine
Ryla was curious; maybe he had some sort of Chrono Psionic.  What happened? 
She regretted asking when his answer was, We died.



 
Railine
Day-1, Night
Location: Reiko-10 Bunkered room

Railine was way out of his element here.  He was tough, and could fight mainly due to his strength and general agility from fire fighting, but tactics, battles, or strategy were something he lacked in his mental arsenal.  “What do we do?” he asked Solide and Aria.  He really needed to get alone with those bodies to finish what he was looking at, or at least get with Ryla as she was the only stable one here.  He would play stupid to the two of them for now.  Unfortunately, he was not a fighter by nature, and in combat had to defer to them.
“Kill the fucks.”
“How?”  Railine’s voice was hurried as Solide did not answer in a meaningful way.
“Depends, you going to play with your little toy or use a gun?”
Railine gripped the axe he had already gotten a kill with.  “I prefer this.”
“And how about our little girl, ready for some violence?”
Ryla sniffled, standing up and looking defiantly proud for a young girl that had been spending much of her time in tears or screaming.  “No, I will not resort to it.”  
“Even if you die, or we die?” Solide asked.  The fact she was not wavering against the man that could likely crush her with a single arm said something about Ryla despite her aspects of emotional weakness.
“It’s a promise, I could not live with myself.”
Solide shook his head, and likely would have swore at anyone else but had a brotherly instinct towards her that might have sometimes bordered on mocking but never hostile.
“There’s three of us to fight.  Three dogs.  To defend this whole base.”  Railine spoke the facts as if listing a manifest.
“I have a good shot here,” Aria said.  They turned to her, and she pointed down the four major hallways of Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Gamma Wings.
Solide looked down one of the halls, then back to her.  “This room is already bunkered.  Ryla stay here and keep the dogs close to you.  They will defend you.  Aria, are you capable of defending this location?”
“I am,” she said to whatever question he was leaning towards.
“And me?” Railine asked.
“We kill some fucks.  Let’s grab some shit, they were—” Down the Alpha hallway a crash came echoing to them.  Ryla yipped for a second but caught it in her throat. Railine froze waiting for another sound but Solide was already moving.
Solide dashed off towards the weapon’s locker – not the way of the sound.  Railine looked confused before Solide waved him over.  Solide was ripping a few of the lockers open, glancing rapidly and throwing stuff around he did not want.  He pocketed a few things that Railine thought were grenades, and in the next locker were some suits of armor.
“You ever use this before?” he asked hurriedly, pointing to some combat plating.
“Yeah, in the basic combat classes back in the academy.”
While that fact was true, Solide likely took it to mean he was far more versed in it than simply using it before.
Solide bear-hugged the heavy plating and dropped a set on the bench for Railine and grabbed another for himself.  It was in a pile that was connected by a red cord that led to a button.  Railine pressed it and the cord rapidly snaked away into straps on each of the independent pieces.
A lot had happened since back then, a lot of highs and lows during his life; could he remember all the little nuances of getting the stuff on the right way?  He could not recall any details but thought it was fairly simple.
“Hurry the fuck up!” Solide yelled.  “Just hold that shit, it auto attaches.”
Railine grabbed the shoulder of the plating, holding it to his left arm.  The oblong shape started reacting rapidly as it slid a couple more plates downwards covering his arm almost to his elbow.  Part of the red cord that held the whole armor package together wrapped up his arm and snuggly tightened it down over his snow jacket.  He held the other to his right arm.  The body armor was a slightly curved plate with a hole to put the head through.  Railine slid it on over his head and there was some soft clicking as more plates snapped downwards over his back and abdomen.  It was structured almost like a turtle shell mixed with sequential roofing of overlapping blocks.  It allowed easy movement and good protection.
He snapped the two leg pieces on which formed almost like a skirt or cape-like look flaring off his legs and with a small protection plate in front of his groin.  Lastly he put the oversized helmet on that at first did not have any clear material to see through.  It rapidly shrank down and lower parts of the helmet rearranged to shield his cheeks and chin while a clear material open by his eyes – very much like a Jet Cycle or Lift Bike helmet in its sleek protection
“Here.”  Solide tossed him a backpack that he quickly caught.  Upon doing so it snaked around his back and fit perfectly over his armor and out of the way.  With only a tug by his shoulder the backpack would come forward so he could easily add or subtract and items.  “You know how to use these, right?”  Solide tossed him a simple Medi-kit.  Railine observed the small package and nodded to answer the question before he added that to the bag as well.  He made a slight throwing motion and the smart satchel responded by moving innocuously to his back side.  He nodded and they both headed off without another word.
Aria had hidden herself completely by the time they came back and Ryla was crouching in a cave of sorts that was made by a table and a wall of furniture on the other side.  The dogs stood by her anxiously, one growling at something.  Solide gave a quick glance at Ryla and the dogs then started running towards
A loud explosive sound rocked the room, Railine feeling it more in his jaw than his aurally-protected ears.  He considered for a moment that he had been shot by Aria, but a quick glance and a lack of pain told him it was not him.  The only thing Railine could think was the sound was Aria’s huge sniper rifle firing.  Ryla was still huddled and Solide was still running forward towards Alpha.  Railine felt a twinge of guilt he had so quickly changed his opinion on Aria and was so suspicious of her now; of course not unfounded.
Reiko-10 was large.  It was a base that housed upwards of 100 people at times, so while it was not that big of a deal to go from one side to the other, for only a few of them defending against an unknown enemy this size now worked against them.  Railine’s nerves were tense as the only thing they would hear is crashes or the occasional retorts of Aria’s rifle blasting somewhere down a hallway.
Near the end of the hall they had yet to encounter anything, which made everything worse as there was a loud sound that originated down here.  Solide had gone all the way to the door to the outside, silently moving to the window.  Without looking behind him he waved Railine over, and as he got close Solide silently pointed forward.  
The snow was blowing but between gusts there was a figure ambling forward.  It was unnerving because the movement was jerky and inhuman, and while somewhat slow it was not encumbered by the snow at all which would normally reduce any Solarian to a crawl.  He blinked, putting on a magnifying layer, and tracked it for a chance in a break of the wind.
“It looks…”
Shhh. – Solide contacted him on ICS.  We don’t know if they hear us.
It doesn’t have the same face, but it’s the same general shape.  Feminine, sad, mutated.  Is that a wing or something on it?
It looks a lot like that sniper bitch.  How well do you know her? – Solide asked.
They continued looking out the window as it was slowly getting closer.  It would shuffle, jerk one way, shuffle again, pause, jerk quickly again.  The speed of the jerk motions implied a quickness to the creature in spite of its currently ambling.
Never knew her before this assignment, but I considered myself close with her.  She did kill Laina which…made me doubt her - Railine did not have a word for the suddenly change of feeling he had.
Just watch your fucking back around her.
‘Laina did not even need to watch her back to be killed by Aria.’ Railine thought to himself grimly.
Solide pushed open the door, aimed his shotgun, and pulled the trigger.  It hit the creature and stopped it for a moment.  Neither of the two men knew what it was doing, perhaps about to fall over dead.  With very little pause it started rushing at them with a terrifying speed.  Solide was a trained fighter and wasted no time pumping another into it.  The second time dropped it into the snow, out of sight forever.
“I can’t believe how fast those things are.”  Solide didn’t respond to his comment.  “Hey.”  Railine nodded towards their left.  It was very vague through the snow, but it appeared there was movement towards another entrance of the base: the ground vehicle bay.  It was far too long of a shot with Solide’s weapon and they looked at each other, closed the door, and started running back to the main room.  For an instant Railine worried about getting plugged by Aria.
“Ryla?” Solide asked.
“I’m here.”
“Is Aria still here?”
“Over here.”  The two of them looked towards the sound and when she lifted an arm and softly waved they saw her amidst the cobbled together fortification.  She was very inconspicuous in general, and when she wanted to, she seemed to be able to hide quite easily.
“Saw a few over here in the vehicle bay,” Railine told them, nodding to his right as the two men ran into the next room, leaving the two women and the dogs behind to guard the main room.
Solide held a hand up and stopped Railine cold.
Behind the APC. – Solide
The lighting of the room cast one vague shadow he watched in an entranced way.  The part of the figure looked like a human girl with long hair and a wing or rod floating above her back, with down-facing triangles – many of which were incomplete or broken.  That unnerving motion they had struck him on a strange visceral level.  It was driven by something inhuman in its desires as it stood there, pausing for a little before a random quick jerk or sway.  He knew how fast they could move when attacking and watching the shadow of this creature right around the corner tried his nerves.
Railine listened for a moment carefully to try to figure out what it was doing, but it was not needed as a loud crash occurred.  Its silhouette had moved quickly in a one-two slash that was damaging something on the other side of them.
Go!
Railine dashed around the corner, seeing the creature as it attacked the vehicle.  He readied a strike at it when it turned.  Part of its face – the part that froze him – looked like a sad female, eyebrows sloped down, a frown along with lost, blank eyes.  Her hair covered part of her face.  It was looking at him with a ‘why do you want to hurt me?’ feeling.  A fraction of her mouth was removed, as if he could see the bone and deep scaring on her cheek.  It almost looked like Aelisha Strives but much more complex as it went towards her eye and down her neck.  
While Railine was paralyzed by its appearance, the long blade on her arm moved with incredible speed.  He was momentarily stunned by the fact this thing looked so much like a relative of Aria.
“The fuck…!?”  Solide barely had time to get it out when the slash hit Railine in the shoulder and part of the axe.  The force was strong, and despite him being twice the size of the thing, it hit Railine backwards as he crashed to the floor.
“Shit,” Solide pulled the trigger and hit the alien-like female hard near the shoulder and a single shot dropped her from his powerful gun.  Solide looked confused as to why they normally took a couple of hits and this one went down easily.  He shot twice more at its head, blowing it away in a splash of dark flesh and blue liquid-gas as it phase-changed out of existence.
The fire fighter was patting his shoulder in shock when the guard came over and stuck out his left hand.  He easily pulled him up and asked, “You get hit?”
“Got hit, but just the armor.”  He held up the axe and there was a gouge that matched the deep rift in the armor that cut part of his winter jacket underneath, but left the soft flesh unharmed.  “How can it cut through armor so easily?”  It was a fair question as this armor was a culmination of Solarian material science and could stop incredible amounts of punishment.
Solide held up a finger.  “More…”
The door to the outside was bashed inwards.  The large metal door creaked loudly, bending in but not fully broke.  “That door is reinforced…” Railine said in shock.  Two more rapid hits and it was enough that some of the creatures came spilling in.  
The surprise of the door bending enough to allow person-sized objects in was still computing in Railine’s mind when Solide had taken a grenade out and with two ‘tinks’ on the ground it incinerated the small group coming in.  Railine’s brain was still a few steps behind, thinking about how using grenades inside likely was not a good idea.
One creature had been too far in and escaped the flame inferno, and with its deceptive speed charged straight at Solide.  The unnatural claw-arm hit the side of his body and helmet and threw him down hard.  Railine naturally reacted this time, swinging the large, advanced axe as it split the alien in two, including cutting off most of the claw as that and the legs dropped to the ground.
The solid hit gave a gruesome satisfaction to Railine, but the feeling was short lived as the creature was still alive.  The upper body with its Solarian arm and alien stump crawled rapidly at Solide still on the ground.  He  lifted his shotgun and destroyed part of its head with a single blow, which finally stopped the thing as it fell forward silently with its soft hair covering its broken head.
Railine glanced rapidly back to the door and did not see any creatures but noticed that the fire from the grenade was rapidly growing in the somewhat flammable atmosphere.  “You okay?”  Solide nodded, and Railine ran out to go grab a fire extinguisher.  
On this planet the air composition included minor oxidizers in a small proportion with the result that fires were much more of a threat than a place like Terra or Lania Prime.  Even with fire suppression systems, and the base constructed of mostly metal, fires could spread very fast.  The fire extinguishers were tailored with special chemicals different than those of normal oxygen/carbon pairing and Railine was easily able to put out the encroaching fire.
The door hung in front of the two men, awkwardly bashed in as a very cold breeze and snow drifted in.  The charred ground and door were steaming but quickly losing heat.
“We need to fix this, can’t afford to let too much heat out.”
“The reactor is still out of tune,” Solide stated.
“Madigan couldn’t fix it,” In Railine’s mind it felt strange giving excuses now.  “It needs some part that can’t be nano-fabricated.”  He started walking out,. “I’m grabbing a block, guard that door if you don’t mind.”
“Don’t tell me what to do.”
Railine left back to the main room, waving reassuringly to Ryla still huddled behind the bunker.  He went over to a storage locker and grabbed a nano repair block before rushing back to the vehicle bay.  
Railine swept two fingers over the repair block and a screen appeared in the air in front of him.  He made some gestures towards the door, ‘tapped’ a few keys, and stuck the block onto the wall.  It turned into a neon green liquid and flowed upwards towards the door.  It spread out like a wide sheet and slowly filled in the entire gaping leak of the door.  He tapped something on a screen that popped up as he got close and the color went from the bright green to the metal color and it was indistinguishable other than the deformity of the entire door knocked inwards.
“You don’t think that will hold more than the door?”
“Of course not,” the damage control man said, “but it’s not about keeping these things out, it’s about keeping our heat in.  Come on, let’s go talk to Aria and Ryla.”  He started walking and passed the corpse of the first one they encountered here that had hit him and Solide had finished.
Something clicked in his mind, and he turned back to the repaired door.  “Hey, this might sound weird…but where are the bodies of the others?”
“What?”  Solide turned himself.  “Huh…what the fuck?”  Solide’s face took an intense look on it as he rapidly scanned around the room, his shotgun ready.
“They were there, right?”
“Like five of them.”
“I’ve seen a lot of burnt bodies, that wasn’t hot enough to incinerate them to complete ash.”  Railine walked forward, and to confirm his confusion there was a box of supplies near one corner of the door that was burnt beyond recognition but was still there.  
The speculation would have to wait as they heard Ryla scream.  Both took off to the next room, dodging around the somewhat damaged APC and before they came into the barricaded room.  
There was one of those creatures near Ryla, engaged in a melee with the dogs.  They could only watch for a moment but it was very strange as the creature seemed unable to comprehend, see, or in some way deal with the dogs.  It kept striving towards Ryla but one of the dogs was clamped onto its leg, another on its claw arm, and the last one snapping at it, growling and backing up with Ryla behind him.
“Ryla run!” Railine yelled.  She was crawling on her butt backwards, and the command snapped her out of it somewhat as she turned and ran towards the two men.  Solide lifted his shotgun and aimed.  “Stop!” Railine cried, pushing his shotgun down.  “The dogs!”
The creature was coming at them fast, slowed only by the dogs it was ignoring.  The dogs were viscously tearing flesh off of the creature and Railine was considering how to attack it when the thing staggered from missing too much leg and fell forward.  The third dog launched at it, and much like how Railine saw a pack of wolves take an elk down once on Laina Prime they tore into it.  Biting, tearing, ripping apart and going for another bite over and over until it was dead.  There was a strange difference as the elk in the frozen tundra bled red and the liquid fell down to the white snow, whereas here it was a splash of blue that turned gas and disappeared.  
The genetically engineered dogs made quick work of the powerful alien in a strange turn of events.  “Hey, come!  Come!”  They eventually listened, and Railine went forward, cutting the body into smaller sections as a safety precaution but it felt unnecessary.
He took a deep breath, looking up and catching the dead body of Laina.
“Where is assassin bitch?” Solide asked.
“Aria?” Railine said.
“I don’t know,” Ryla repied, holding onto Solide’s forearm.  He did not push her off, likely the only girl here he would allow that for.  “I saw that thing coming and coming, waiting for her to kill it.  Only the dogs saved me.”  She ran over to the three dogs, kneeling down and rustling their brown and black fur as they licked her.  “Are you guys okay?” she asked while standing up her voice hurried.  “I heard a lot of fighting.”
Railine slung the axe over his shoulder and his armor put a thin tie-down on it to hold it there until he would need it later.  He pushed a button as his helmet unrolled from in front of his face, rolling backwards and down until it became a small tube that resembled a thick collar above the body armor.  He sighed as he ran a hand through his short hair.  “So much is happening in such a short time.  These things seem intelligent, as least to some level, but then on others...” He pointed to where the creature had been torn apart by the dogs.  “They were attacking our APC.  Solide killed a bunch, but their bodies are gone.  Then,” he lifted his hand, “Aria disappears and…”  He had a very hard time saying what he knew needed to be said about a woman he had become close friends with.  “All these things look very much like Aria.”
“Why?”  Ryla looked naively up at the larger man.
“Don’t know.”  He then directed the next message only to Solide through ICS.  Clearly you have been in combat, I’m worried about Aria potentially ambushing us.  Any ideas?
I’ve considered that.  We make Ryla lead into every room, she tells us if clear, or if she gets hit then we know.  The suggestion punched Railine in his stomach.
He glanced back at Rox and Laina spewed out on the floor.  Here Railine was loosely allied with Solide who had started the murder train, and now faced the strange balance of his friend Aria looking darker and darker every moment.  Railine put a hand on a table in the wall and vaulted the small bunker to get into the middle.  He bent down to Laina’s body again and stuck his two fingers into her heart cavity.  It was cold which on a level was refreshing to know, and there was not any apparent movement of nanites, suggesting she was dead.  He lifted his hand out and watched the blood on his fingers as it slowly drifted down his wrist.
“The fuck are you doing?  Both those bitches are long dead.”
Railine raised his hand and reversed it, so that his hand was hanging down and wrist was up.  “Conventionally I would completely agree with you.  But have you ever seen blood do this?”  He pointed with his other hand as small globs of blood moved upwards against gravity.  The blood was not moving towards the planet as it should in every other case, it was moving towards Railine.
“What the fuck?”  Solide’s mouth was open as Ryla likewise stood in shock as they watched the blood behave in a way a liquid never should.

 
Railine
Day 2, Morning
Location: Reiko-10,  Medical Lab

“You don’t think you have to worry about getting whatever that was?” Ryla was asking Railine.  The three survivors were in the medical lab while he was shuffling through equipment.  They had made Ryla go in first.
“My skin is unbroken, and nanites ward off most things, but whatever was inside Laina I cannot say for sure.”  Of course that did not stop him from washing his hands, and disinfecting it with three different chemicals.
Solide walked over to the main table, dropping the box as it made a sound of glass hitting itself.  It was dropped from a high enough distance that a casual observer might think they broke. “What’s the plan here, Mr. Scientist?”  
Railine grabbed a couple of small, completely undamaged dima-glass vials out of the box.  In front of him was a variety of different lab equipment he had assembled: an assortment of various small vials, petri dishes, and flasks were flanked by a stack of valuable blood paks and some very valuable ReNew Paks.
“We are going to see if those things are Solarian.”
“What the fuck?  That doesn’t matter.  I didn’t help you for something dumb like that.”
He could tell Ryla was not supporting him either through her downcast facial expression.  “Why does it matter?  They are hostile to us.”
Railine stood his ground, shaking his head.  “No, think about it.  They all look female, kind of like Aria, disturbingly enough, but not across the board.”
“One looked like that slut Feyloose.”
“Her name is Feyria,” Ryla corrected the older man.  Solide turned and stared at her, she shut up.
Railine continued, glad Ryla corrected the name ‘Feyria’ as he thought her name was Feyro .  “For some reason they looked somewhat like people we know, not to mention you were suspicious of Feyria.  The idea I have is we check the bodies of those aliens and see if they are Solarian.”  
He didn’t want to mention that there were questions in his mind if there was some spiritual event occurring here which was why it involved people he knew.  He could not formulate the idea thoroughly, so much as just a passing thought if there was more to it.  Wishing he had more time to think down this avenue, he had to let it go for now.
“But they have those wing things, we don’t have anything like that,” Ryla said.  It was clear Ryla was trying to derail his ideas as well.  Solide was a lot more upfront and simple to understand, he thought it was stupid because he could not see conceive of anything beyond his face.  It didn’t portend well that Ryla was evasive.  As to why, he had no idea.  She seemed young and naïve, but something about it felt off.  Railine was good at reading people due to his general introversion and experience watching people and that is what gave that slight feeling of inconsistency.
Humbly he answered back, “I don’t have answers, I am simply pursuing paths that may give us additional clues.  I can’t explain that part.  They look like us, but…their flesh is almost rotted off yet…”  He was struggling for the words, because ‘rotted’ was not close to what it was.  It was closer to burned.  He pointed to his cheek.  Realizing a small irony about what he was suggesting, and the fact his own face had burn scars clawed through it.  “I could see the jawbone on one of them.  They have these dark marking over their face and neck.  They have our jackets on , that should be proof enough .”
“Hmm.”  Ryla looked puzzled and scratched her face as she was deep in thought.  “That is a pretty obvious piece of evidence, but what they get mutated ?”
Was she finally getting it?  He tried to pounce, “That’s what I am wondering.  Is there any Solarian tissue or DNA in them?”
“I am not going into details, and really never wanted to bring it up, but I had encountered these things before.”  Both of them turned to the guard with a frequent foul mouth.  At this point, Solide knowing more than the lowly guard he pretended to be did not come as a surprise so much as a confirmation that this situation was far more complex than they could imagine.  
He explained, “I don’t think you are wrong about the suits.  But it doesn’t fully line up either.  We were sent into a colony as a rescue mission.  We saw these little fucks, and they were dressed in colonial clothes.”
Railine was tempted to ask, ‘Doesn’t that prove my point?’ but kept listening.
“So in that regard you seem right.  But once we got there, and especially after we started fighting, we saw them with some of our clothes.  Military clothes.”
Railine merely filed it away that in fact he had some sort of military experience in his past.  “Was this after your guys died?  Was it them, like it might be here?”
“That’s where it got real fucking weird.  Yes, our guys did die, but it wasn’t them.”  
Railine was confused by what was being implied here.  “How do you know?”
“No one gets left behind.  Initially anyway till it turned to shit.  We started seeing them even while we had every single person accounted for .”
“Oh…” it was such a simple word he muttered out, but the revelation was powerful.  Railine looked down at the small little glasses.  His idea seemed really dumb and inadequate in a world spiraling out of control.  He could not give up, even if the idea was worthless, that was one step towards the real answer.  Enough wrong answers would leave only the truth left.
Solide kept talking, and pointed back towards the main room.  “Those things are intelligent, or at least guided by an intelligence.  They were trying to fool us.”
“How?  They don’t blend in, they just fight.”
“They only attack us,” Ryla said in a sad tone.  “What intelligence goes to violence as its first choice?”
Solide stared hard at him, “These things are the shock troops, the real ones blend in.”
Railine froze for a moment, his stomach falling away from him.  “Oh no…Rox and Laina…That blood isn’t Solarian.”  He glanced at his hand.  He was no longer sure his natural defenses and the heavy washing was adequate for whatever had happened.  Were those two women the ‘real’ ones that blend in better?  Railine wanted to ask him as many questions as possible, but based on the story there was not any further information.
Solide shrugged, “I am a killer, so I don’t know much about their blood.  Other than we got betrayed by one.”
Railine thought about an odd hole in the story.  Solide claimed all the people were accounted for, but that he got betrayed by someone.  There was a gap that needed explaining, it offered a clue to their situation.  Railine was about to ask when Ryla began on a new topic.
“That wing thing, if you can call it that.”  Ryla made a motion of lifting her two arms up above her head.  “Clearly not Solarian, so how does that fit into this picture?”
“That’s another thing that confuses me.  You know what it reminds me of?”  Solide answered his own question before the other two could speak, “Daijin energy plates or harmonizers or whatever the fuck they’re called.”
“The Daijin!?”  Ryla looked scared that the massive alien empire might be involved.
“You’re saying this is a Daijin Star weapon?” Railine asked.  He knew the two races were loosely in combat but given the massive size of empires neither had fully committed to ‘War’ yet due to its costs; unlike the much more hostile Burn which many empires now openly fought.
The Daijin’s did have ‘wings’ of sorts that hovered behind them and were some way they harnessed energy.  But, the Daijin’s had large sheets that could be described as artistic, whereas these figures had small, weak and disfigured poles.  In Railine’s mind there was not a connection other than the oddity that they both were wings, but other races had wings too.  “These are Daijins?”
 “I have no fucking clue.  But Daijin wings aren’t physically connected and look very much like what the true form of those things look like, their fucking wings anyway.”
“The ‘True Form’…” Railine repeated, scarcely imagining what it might be like.
A new soft voice surprised them all.  “Excuse me.”  They all turned, Solide bringing his custom shotgun ‘Claim Jumper’ to bear and Railine swung his axe towards the sound.  It was the sad looking sniper Aria.  Her long, pure black hair hung past her thin waist, nearly to her butt where he thicker legs were hugged tight by the winter pants.
“Hey hey hey, another killer joins the party,” Solide laughed at his own joke but kept his gun up.
“Where were you, Aria?” Railine asked coldly.
“There was a sound down in Gamma.  I did not have a clean shot and went to take it out.”
Her excuse hung in the air for a while.
“Why didn’t you come to help Ryla?”
She lifted her left hand, and brushed one of her soft bangs out of her eye.  Railine could barely read Strives, but her cross plus and arrow sign meant something about ‘far sight’.  “I took it out the one I heard, and at the door outside saw two more that I hunted down.”
“Everyone suspects you,” Solide said.  Railine did not like it, because it was not like he did anything different.
“Why would they?”  Aria asked innocently.  She had a naivety or infantilism of sorts with social matters.
“Cause you murdered that medical bitch then left us.”
She tilted her head confused. , “Were your actions not similar?”
He slapped his armor plating on his chest,.  “Yeah, but I’m Solarian.” 
“The proclamation seems unfounded, I can claim the same.”  She then looked at Railine.,  “Is there a problem here?”
Railine contacted Ryla on a private ICS line.  You and I are the only ones we can trust for sure.  Aria has a good point that both of them did the same thing.  Both are murderers.
I like Solide, but after he killed Rox I became wary.  I imagine it’s the same for you and Aria?  - Ryla
Logically, we take both or neither.  We aren’t in the position to go alone.  I feel some worry in my heart.  - Railine
I don’t tell many people this, because a lot judge me, but I can feel how people are, if they are going to attack.  I felt it both with Rox and Laina.  If I feel it towards either of us I will let you know.  – Ryla
That sounded awfully an awful lot like Psionics.  Railine glanced at the small girl and gained a deeper respect that there was more than being let on here.
“Railine?”  Aria asked to the long physical silence.
“You made me worried, but we might not be in a position to refuse help.”
“You’re going to believe that bitch?  Half of them look like her.”
Aria was solemn,.  “I am aware of that disturbing coincidence.” 
Railine would believe her for now, because his idea was coming to fruition and would tell him everything he needed to know about everyone around him.  He re-slung his axe, turned away from her and said, “Come grab these blood paks, we are moving back to the main room.”  He positioned his axe and pried open the locker door and after some hassle eventually opened it up like a can enough to get the box of them out.
Solide scoffed once, grabbed his box, and headed off first.  Railine grabbed a few clean knives, shoved the rest in a box and headed out with the two girls carrying things in tow.
Solide was over the barricade and took the four boxes they handed him.  It was a bit unnerving that the bodies were piled inside the barricade but there was nothing to do about it.
“So Mr. Scientist, I can stick around for your little biology experiment why while you fuck around with these things, or do something useful and go get some explosives from the storage.”
“I don’t want anyone leaving.”
Solide smirked.  “You aren’t stopping me.”
He vaulted over the table, and instead of going to the vehicle bay, or perhaps Alpha Wwing for the quickest way to the explosive storage room, he headed towards the weapons locker.  He came back quickly, and tossed a medium sized weapon with a circular tank on the back side of it.  It hit the ground and skidded near Railine.  “You shot water before right?  Same fucking idea.”
Railine bent down and picked up the Jetstream.  Toggling the switch up front the ignited a small pilot light ignited.  Railine was a fire fighter who’s whose job was sometimes to start fires, the rare time back burning was more effective.  Jetstreams were used on planets that fire did not burn as readily.  O, on a planet like this the flamethrower could be a very powerful weapon.
“Why are you leaving?”  Ryla asked him.
“I don’t want to waste time watching this stupid shit.  They are our enemies.  W, we can tell these things, and we can’t tell the true ones.  Slicing them up does nothing.  The only thing we need is more fire power, and there are some good weapons in the storage.  I’ll bring them back.”
“I’d prefer if you don’t go.  I have a test I want to run through here.”
“I don’t give a fuck what you want.  I am Solarian and if you want to shoot me that’s one less of you.  I will be back.”  He headed out the Alpha Wwing door and the other three were silent.
“Trusting him is difficult,.”  Aria said in her way of minimum words but big truth.
Railine took a deep breath, let it out slowly, ‘Let it go…let it go…’ he repeated to himself.  He turned to face the two women.  “Here is my idea.  U, using the blood paks, or maybe even a ReNew Pak, we test it with the alien tissue.  The idea is that those things are programmed to interact with our tissue.  I understand you may not have a clue to my intention, so…,”  Railine went over to Aria holding the blood pak box, took a small vial out, grabbed a petri dish, and stepped back.
He took his axe off his back, squirted disinfectant over it, then brought it near his arm.  “I’m going to show you what I already know.,”  hHe slide the mono edge over part of his forearm, it which rapidly dripped blood into the dish.  He sat it down on a clear spot in the bunker they had made what seemed like a long time forever ago.  He lifted his forearm, wiping the cut clean.  “An injury like this is a waste of a blood pak, as my nanites would help it fairly fast but…,”  Hhe opened it up and squirted some of the liquid on his arm.  Within moment the wound healed closed and stopped bleeding.  “Cute trick, but a waste of such valuable medical supplies.  Regardless, it shows that the Solarian blood pak recognizes me as such.  Likewise,” he spilled continued, spilling the rest into the dish of his blood.  He presented it to Aria.  “I know you don’t have a microscope, but a standard lens should be fine.  C, can you tell us if the reaction looks normal?”
Aria warily held the dish, looking down at it with a magnified lens of nanites over her eye.  “Yes.  They are interacting but confused as it is not part of your body.”
Ryla shrugged,.  “I don’t get it.  What are we looking for, or what is it supposed to show?”
“That I am not a monster,” Railine said definitively.
“Did you think you were?”  Ryla asked sincerely.
“No, but I needed to prove the science was sound.”  Railine looked down the hall Solide had left out of.  “He used the term ‘infection’ and maybe these things are what we turn into.”  He walked towards one of the mauled bodies.  “So either way we could potentially see some interesting results.  Either these alien creatures still have Solarian nanite reactions – suggesting they were indeed us, or second…”  He did not continue.
“Or what?”  Ryla asked.
It hung in the air for a while, before Aria turned to her. , “To make sure we are who we say we are,.”  Tthe tactless admission was silent in the room.
“What…!?  What?!”  Ryla swung her arms down by her side, walking up to Aria who only stared at her coldly.  She ran over to Railine,.  “Are you for real?”  He looked at her with an unwavering gaze, biting his lower lip as a result of the uncomfortable path he was committed to.  “I hate blood, why do you think I have such a hard time with this?”
“I am doing Aria too.”
“No, you are not.”  He turned to face the quiet woman’s denial.
“I thought you might say that Aria.  You were one of the only two that I can’t account for easily.  A, along with a passing similarity to these aliens, if it should be anyone, it’s you.”
She blinked slowly, having a quiet pride in her face. , “There is no telling your method even works.”
Railine gritted his teeth and was earnestly thinking of just forcing these two to submit.  He was considering what to do or say when she continued. , “I am not saying I will not do it, but I want to see if it works at all, and I will be drawing my own blood to prevent infection.”
It was enough that he didn’t push the point.  He walked over to one of the bodies and bent down, grabbing the Solarian-ish arm.  H, he lifted it and sliced it carefully on his axe, but nothing happened.  He did not expect blood, exactly, but at least that blue liquid they had seen.  He slashed a different part and nothing.
He dropped the arm, silently going over to the tools they had brought and grabbed a big syringe.  He stabbed it deep into the arm, and pulled the plunger back.  Empty.
“This complicates things,” he admitted.  He placed it to the side, and grabbed a new one.  Something was up with Rox,; the moving blood  was so abnormal it would prove his test.  He went over and bent down, picked up her cold arm and cutting open the skin, having  and had to squeeze it to produce any blood.  He could hear Ryla gagging behind him.
He stood up with the dish, realizing the blood looked normal right now, n.  Not moving like it had was earlier.  He was partly ready for it to just react completely normally and make him seem even more crazy.  He walked over to Aria who had a small box of blood paks, took another one out, opened it, and poured it in.
“Whoa…!”  He jumped back and almost dropped the dish out of surprise.  “Look!”  He shouted with excitement that his idea was vindicated.  Where he had dropped it in, it formed a small blob formed encircled by Rox’s  blood.  There was no mixing going on;, it was like oil and water.
“It works,” Aria stated.
“What does it mean though?” Ryla asked nervously.
“I am not sure,” he admitted.  He swirled the dish a bit and to his surprise they mixed without too much effort.  “Hmm, I might have messed it up.”  He stopped moving and in a little bit of time they separated back into different groups.  Swirling mixed them once again.  
Railine looked to Aria.,  “Any idea?”
She brushed a bang of black hair out of her eye, looking closer,.  “It’s similar enough that they can be forced to mix, but it’s different enough that the blood pak nanites aren’t reacting the correct way.”  She stared down at Rox .  “She might not have been Solarian.”
“What?”  Ryla asked in a near shriek.  “But…she looks like us!”
“Agents can look like us,.”  Aria said in her style of leaving so much unsaid.
A new masculine voice had come in, “Sounds like I was right blowing that bitch away.”  Solide hads surprisingly come back, and not with not much time gone.  Railine gained a lot of trust in him.
“Look, this test I came up with, my blood reacted normal, but Rox’s isn’t acting right.”  Solide jumped over the barricade, coming on the large inner circle where a few bodies were mauled apart.
‘How strange it doesn’t even faze him to be next to this woman he killed,.’ t Thought Railine.
“What am I looking at?”  Railine showed him the separate blood, shook it, forcing it together, and slowly it separated back out.  “And?”
“And Blood paks  don’t do that.  I proved it with my own.  We are going to test everyone here next, now that we know it works.”
Solide shot back, “No.  Second, what the fuck was she then?”
Railine turned back to the body of a friend of hiswhat was once a friend.  It always bothered him seeing dead bodies like this, because he would think about how this morning she picked those specific beads to wear in her hair.  Now she would never decide such simple things again.  “Don’t know.  Aelisha agent maybe?  Anyway, I trust everyone here, but we need to test this so we are all on the same page.”
“I want to see your ass do it.”
“I did.”
“Again,.”  Solide picked as his one word.
“He did,.”  Ryla said.
Railine shook his head no, went over and grabbed the right stuff, taking another blood pak from Aria and repeated the test, this time skipping the healing on his cut arm, and only doing the blood.  He put it on a table for them to watch, and used the rest of the pak on his arm cut, sealing it completely very quickly .
“Guess this is supposed to mean something?”  Solide asked.
“That I am Solarian.  You already saw with Rox.,”  Railine hated being manipulative but added, “So guess you were right about whatever feeling you had about her.”
Fortunately, he was susceptible to some degrees of manipulation.  “That’s right, I had a bad feeling about that bitch.”
Railine lifted up a new dish.,  “Everyone here needs to do this.  I couldn’t get anything from the aliens, so that original idea of seeing if anyone of us were a monster is useless.  But, seeing Rox, it would be a weight off of each of us here.  If you don’t have anything to hide.”
Solide took a deep breath in, closing his eyes, everyone preparinged for a torrent of profanity.  He opened them, smiling a smile on his face.  “Sure.  That makes sense to me.  A, ain’t got nothing to hide here, boys and girls.”
“Aria, do you want to do it for him?” Railine offered.
“Whoa…”  Solide reacted fast,.  “You are the only one clean here, as far as I’ am concerned.”
“So you will let me?”  
Solide nodded. , “I don’t want to be breaking the needle off in my own arm or some shit.”
Railine prepared everything. , Solide sat there smirking and unflinching as a small plunger was filled with his blood.  Squirting Railine squirted it into the waiting blood pak in the dish as everyone watched nervously.  Watched and nNothing happened.  It mixed completely, and reacted normally.
Ryla’s voice was meek, “Do I really have to?  I hate needles and blood so bad.”
“Yes,” both men answered quickly.  She looked ready to cry.
“We should do Laina, she had the same odd blood,” Aria suggested.
“Good idea, but you first,” Solide said.  He had rapidly gotten on board of Railine’s idea.  He was vindicated in his own way, gunning down some sort of outsider and now the proof of it in a lot of waysthe multitudes of proof absolved him of any wrong doing.
“Laina first,” Aria said.
“You’re doing it bitch!”  Solide yelled.
“Aria, we need you to do it,” Railine said, a foil to the hot-headed and angry Solide.
“Fine,” she slowly relented.  Railine went to prepare another test, when she said, “I’ll do it myself.”
She took a small vibro blade out of a package, a dish, and a blood pak.  She looked at her thumb morosely for a moment, drawing a long slash down it as the blood started flowing freely.
“Oh god…”  Ryla turned away, coughing and gagging.
She opened the blood pak, and first put it on her thumb, which actually healed.  Dumping the rest into the dish, it again mixed.  “Look?” s She asked.  The two men shook their head,; it was clear she was good.
Solide taunted her a little while pointing at Laina,.  “Now we see if you are a hero like me, or a murderer.  Why don’t you do the honors?”
Aria nodded, taking the box of blood paks over, and some small sample equipment.
Ryla had come up and grabbed onto Solide’s arm because she was scared.  He yanked his arm away.  “You’re next.”
“I know.”  Ryla looked very dejected, but given the nature of what was happening, it was tough to blame her.  “I have nothing to hide.”
“Good, because I like you.”
She might have blushed once, mis-understanding his comment, but for now she was only weary.
Railine was feeling really tired.  So much had been happening.  It all started with the weird dream he had seen where he saw some of what was going to happen.  It stopped being accurate and the only real thing it did was warn him of that alien surprise attack an extra moment.  Perhaps that was the entire purpose, to just give him an extra little edge to survive.  He would have to read up on Senses/Psionics much more when they got out of this.
Aria was setting everything up, but Railine felt wary.  He looked at Solide that who looked like a hungry animal.  W, was Solide going to attack them?
Aria reached down to grab Laina’s dead arm.  Ryla was in the room but was holding her mouth and looking away. , Railine watched warily wondering if his idea was way off base.  Aria was his friend so she would not say anything and Ryla was too timid, but he felt bad on some level burning blood Paks on something that might not work.  Even if it should show that Laina’s blood was different, it didn’t really mean anything other than traitors were in the midst which that were now dead.
Railine was in his mind thinking about the next move after Laina and then Ryla’s test when a voice from someone that had died pierced through the air.  “Perfect timing.,”  Tthe words dripped with sarcasm.   as Railine’s eyes went wide as the dead body of Laina was grippinggripped Aria’s arm.  “That was a devious attack, I did not expect it out of you.”
In the next instant Laina, who was shot, dead, and cold on the floor, was animated and pulled with an incredible force as shethat ripped Aria’s arm right off.  There was a large burst of red blood out before white fluid was spurting out of her shoulder.  
“Aiieee…!”  hHer scream was shrill as she fell to the ground twisting away.  Ryla was screaming again but Railine stood there shocked as Laina was hovering slightly off the floor.
Her head was down, a few strands of her bangs blocking her face.  Sshe lifted a hand, snapped her finger, and lifted her face which was now completely fine and void of the hole Aria had previously shot through her.  “Cute trick is it not?” s She asked the stunned Railine and Solide.
Her face no longer had her Strive on its left side, but had dark markings across her face like some sort of runes or tribal energy leylines,, her eye pupils were now vertically aligned.
“I really hate seeing the fear in your face…”  As Laina spoke, hovering in the air, the wings they had seen in incomplete forms on the others appeared behind her.  They were not connected, but turned with her as she did.  I, it had a long flat pole of sorts that extended in both directions and these had multicolored diamond shapes that descended and slightly interlocked.  The single layer of these diamonds composed the entirety of the ‘wing’ and was about the height of half a torso.
He stood there in confusion, never seeing a dead person suddenly alive in with such a different look and maiming the first person to touch them.
Suddenly there wasA a large boom, as and from Railine’s point of view a line of blue shot out from Laina’s chest upwards like a laser beam as gas rose up quickly following the blue trail off theis line before it all disappeared.
“Railine, attack her!”  Aria was leaking out mixed color liquid, crouching on the ground and holding her heavy rifle one-arm as she shot again at Laina.  The bright blue blood liquid-to-gas burst out of her in the same way it did with the mutated figures.  This time the round also hit part of the wing as it made a shattering sound.  T and the green diamond was broken and turned colorless as a crack rapidly traveled up the single crystal.
“Tenacious…I hate that.”  Laina lifted her right hand and moments later, out of nothing, purple, angular razor projectiles blasted out and flew straight through Aria, cutting her apart as her cleaved body fell to the ground in a plop.  A few more embedded themselves in her, pinning her down to the floor.  Her beautiful hair, her toned body, her forlorn face…all, hardly recognizable.
“Fuck…”  Solide at least uttered something whereas Railine was frozen.
“Gahh…li…ne….”  Aria muttered out as she was rapidly was dying.
‘Holy…’  The shock and the final stand of his friend triggered something that caused him tohe at least react tthis time reacted.
He fumbled for the flamethrower slung over his back.  H, his hands were shaking bad and he was very fortunate it was not a precise shot that was needed.  The barrel convulsed violently from his shaking as his whole palm gripped the trigger as and he lifted the flamethrower.  T and the lit stream burst out, covering the room in flame.  He held and held as the heat grew stronger and stronger and could not see anything in the on-coming wall of fire.
“Look out!”  A small weight hit him in his knees,; it was only the area and not the momentum that knocked him down.
“Ryla what…!?”
Right above him there was a ‘tickticktick’ sound as a flurry of the those crystal shards that blew Aria apart flew past and lodged into the floor before they dissolved in a pink sparkle as it they faded away.  Ryla’s small body had moved Railine enough to dodge the attack.
Solide finally snapped back into action, yelling, “Shit!”  There were three rapid shots of a shotgun to their right.  “Move!”  He Railine felt a strong arm grab him and his other arm lifted both him and Ryla up as they struggled out of the room.  Railine was still in a confused state as when he saw Solide take two green spheres, toggle something, and throw them into the fire, ducking behind the door they were indove behind.
He coveredSolide took cover as they exploded and lifted his shotgun, blasting and blasted over and over into the room, certainly not looking at anything.  “Fire, you stupid fuck!”  He turned to Railine before shoving a block through the ammo processor as it made a ‘zzzuuuuu’ sound, absorbing as it absorbed the necessary parts and ejectinged the empty casing.
Railine shot to the other side of their door and lifted his flamethrower,  and hosinged the room down like he had a hundred times with water.  Even through his scarred skin and lack of many nerves remaining the heat began to get to him.  The destruction they unleashed into the room was unbelievable, especially considering it was not even targeted .
Solide stopped shooting, and held his shotgun nervously;, the flames shone off all three of the survivors faces.
“I’m going to get a fire extinguisher.,”  Solide grabbed Railine and shook his head no.  “But the room will be destroyed, the whole base will burn down.”  The sprinkler system clearly was not working, and at this point there was no way to figure out why not.  In the end it was a minor detail really, given everything else occurring.
“It’s already destroyed, if that thing doesn’t die, we do.”
Railine calmly said back to him, “If this base dies, we die,” and left.
“What about Aria?”  Ryla asked with a slight hysteria.
Solide put a hand on Ryla.  T, the movement was not typical for him but it did not come off as odd or forced.  “She is dead.  Don’t cry, I will protect you.”
She sniffed a bit.,  “I’ll try.  Thank you.”
Railine came back, holding the extinguisher but letting it the fire burn a bit more due to the fear of that creature.  The three of them stood there watching the licking flames of the room.  Both of them takingRailine and Ryla took a cue from the clearly experienced Solide who was ready but stood in a generally relaxed stance.  Solide hit a button by the neck of his helmet as it unrolled from his face, and down the back to nothing more than a thick collar, which is how Railine’s had been ever since they came back from the ground vehicle bay..  They both had their armor on, but their helmets had for all appearances melted away into a thick necklace/collar.
In front of them there was a crack and some part of the ceiling collapsed inwards.  For a moment the influx of air raised the flames.  The cold air and snow was slowly putting the fire out unlike the composition of atmosphere which favored combustion.  At the this point the main room was slowing down burning, but the wind was forcing it down other hallways where it was spreading.
Railine was began spraying down the flames that were coming out of the room at the edge of the hallway they were in that were coming out of the room.  He had considered spraying it into the destroyed room, but decided to let the flames burn.  A, as hard as it was with Aria in there, it was probably for the best.  She was likely dead anyway, but not wasn’t fully sure.  “I bet it’s probably spreading to the other side,.” Railine mused.
“Probably,.”  Solide said with no emotion.
The product of his training eventually over-powered the thought that the Laina-creature was still alive and he let it rip into the room which, for the most part, was did not have not much left having since it had been burned quiteet thoroughly with the mix of the furniture and atmospheric concentration of gases.  He headed over to the other three wingds, and the side rooms, catching the spreading fire before it got too out of control.
Ryla had ducked back, grabbing an extinguisher herself and was putting out spot fires in the barricaded room that was now collapsed in the middle.  The cold ripping in from the ceiling tore at her jacket and it was with reluctance she put the fires out.  Railine came back and was staring at the collapsed metal structure near the center of the room.  It was where Laina, Rox, and now Aria  all lay dead.  
Tears were coming down the hardened man’s face as the smoke drifted away in the winter wind.  She Ryla almost cried simply seeing the emotion he was going through.
“I’d be tempted to berate that girl, but we owe her a lot,” Solide said.  Ryla  thought that he was likely talking about Aria.
“I don’t understand. , Aria killed Laina out of the blue…”  Ryla’s voice begged for an answer.  “Then she came back.  How does that happen!?”
“Aria helped pre-kill her, she was never dead,” Solide said back to the solo conversation the two of them were having while Railine cried silently about his quiet friend that had died not far from him.  In the final moments she had done what she could to buy them some time perhaps, valiantly firing as she was killed.
“What do you mean pre-kill?”  Ryla asked.
“We’re lucky.”  Solide went to turn around to leave the room.
“Wait!”  She grabbed his wrist.
He turned towards her, grabbed both her shoulders and pulled her into an embrace.  She was stiff at first, but then started crying from the feeling of protection of the larger, older man.  “We are fortunate she stayed in that form.  They take far more damage, and Aria must have got a jump on her.”  Ryla sobbed as she was held in Solide’s strong chest.
“She killed her,” Railine stated, wiping the tears off his burn-scarred face.  Remembering He recalled the weird act of Aria baiting Laina into attacking her only to turn around and kill her with her large sniper rifle.
Solide looked over Ryla’s head and her one ribbon on the sidesingle side ribbon at Railine. , “Wrong, she was never dead.  We can’t understand their behavior, and she likely planned on that.  Laina was what we are calling Death Angels.  S, she didn’t die the first time.”
Railine looked down and watched Ryla shift and pull herself tighter into Solide.  He felt bad for the young woman;, he was tough and this was hard to endure even for him.
“She is dead now though, right?”  Railine asked.
“Probably, or else she’d still be fighting.  I can’t fucking understate how vital it was Aria did so much damage to her in Solarian form.  Laina must have either not expected it or...  Fuck, I can’t even call that thing a name.  That Death Angel underestimated that sniper girl…and we are alive because of the damage she took.”
Railine thought back to the events. , “She shot her twice for sure as our form, and she shot her at least two more times when she revealed herself.”  To him it did not exactly compute but Solide was very convinced of this ‘pre-kill’ fact.”
“What were you doing anyway?” he Solide asked.
“Laina was killed because we were arguing about what to do.  I had an idea about a test using our blood as a base, Laina did not like it at all. , Aria baited Laina into slapping her and proceeded to kill her right there.  Maybe Laina knew it might show something.  Ironically, I was inspired by your words and thought there was some way to test for whatever infection you were talking about.”
Solide scoffed.  “I’m pleased as shit you think I understand anything.  I’d only fought these things before, I don’t have a fucking clue about them.  Are you telling me that entire blood test was because I said something about infections?”
“You used theo word ‘infect’ and it was in reference to that other group,.”  Railine said strongly.
“All because I used the word ‘infect’?”
Railine was disturbed. , “Yes, it was.  Why did you use the word then?”  Ryla had broken off of him, perhaps in advance of an argument between them.
He shook his head no rapidly. , “I used it fucking loosely, not biologically.  That’s what it was like for the Elyria Modality also.  I did n’ot suspect her at the time, no one did.”  Solide’s term was unfamiliar to Railine.  “Fuck.  I truly believed she was clean before…”  Solide’s voice faded off and his eyes dazed.  It was a motion that told Railine he had a past far more compliacted than he ever let on. 
It was silent for a while before Railine spoke.  “Anyway, the idea I had was going off your word ‘infection’, which sounds like it might not have been right at all, but to see if there would be a reaction between this alien tissue and our own.”
Solide nodded, though his words disagreed.  “Like I said, it didn’t seem biologic.  But I was mostly trying to live, not do fucking science.  But somehow some people ‘got it’ and then proceeded to kill everyone.”
Railine moved his head up and down,.  “Almost same idea I suppose.  The idea was that blood and ReNew paks are designed to interact very specifically with Solarian nanites, and that fake blood would not trigger a reaction.  In a way the medical technology not working was what I hoped might reveal them.”
“It works on Aelisha too,” Solide said.
“Really?  They do?  I didn’t know that.  Maybe my whole idea was unfounded.”
“I’d been in enough battles, trust me, they work on Aelisha, or given our tech is Aelisha’s it’s likely more accurate to say they work on us.  Regardless, your idea seemed like it might work.  D, did you find anything?”
“Well you saw the second part of it.  The lesser creatures don’t bleed, and the blood pak doesn’t heal their arm.  Admittedly, it may be that they are dead, since I am not sure blood paks work on dead tissue.  Regardless, the test seemed conclusive.  A, at least it differentiated between us, and whatever Rox and Laina were.”
The cold frozen air made it tolerable enough to endure tohe once-ablaze room, but without the fire, heat was very rapidly leaking out of the base.  Most of the smoke had cleared, and there was only the crashed ceiling that buried Aria and Laina in part of the room, excluding a char everything had.
“Help me with this Solide. , Ryla, take this nano block, you know how they work right?  Set it to the right mode.”  She nodded and he along with Solide lifted a large beam up to the roof as she rubbed the block between the present wall and the beam the two strong men were holding.  Through a mix of welding the material as well as laying down its own layer, it bonded the pieces together nearly instantly.  He Railine came over and took the block from her, twisted it to generate the screen on it, programmed the order, and held it up to the wall.
It turned into an ooze and flowed upwards, gathering material as it went and began laying a thin layer of metal down across the roof that was open to the outside.  In a short period of time the room had been resealed with the thin layer of metal and re-purposed construction nanites.  For all intents it was a completed repair as heat was no longer escaping.
Railine continued, “I did not mean to interrupt the conversation, but I couldn’t let the room leak out valuable heat, especially since the reactor has still been acting up.  Anyway, so I tried it on myself before you got back. , I had nothing to hide and predictably the blood pak reacted and interacted with my blood.  To top it off, putting it back on my wound healed it right away.”
“Did you waste any ReNew Paks?”  he Solide asked.
“No.  Too rare, so just tried to blood pak first.”
“Then?”  Solide asked impatiently.
“Everyone else wanted to see it done on the aliens, but they don’t bleed.  They bleed gas or something.  We could not get anything out of them.”
“What was even the point?  It was three of your left.  You didn’t suspect either of them, did you?”
Railine looked at the only other womaen left, pausing before speaking, “No, not really.  I suppose I got fixated by the idea and didn’t think it through.  We were at each other’s throat already and I wanted a way to prove we were all the same.  I took to heart your comment that someone on the other team was already infected too.”
“Oh, I don’t doubt that.  It’s that pilot for sure.”
“How do you know?”  Ryla wanted to know, as Feyria was her mentor.  Beautiful, skilled, and well liked.
Solide turned to her, he wipedwiping away something on his forehead asnd it left a dark ash mark near his spiked-back hair.  “She act’s really skanky but she is way smarter than she let’s on.”
Railine jumped in, “Meaning what?  She was playing us?  Laina and Rox didn’t act out.  Rox’s intelligence was not notable, relatively, at all.”
“Is it always girls?”  Ryla asked.
“I…don’t know.  All the ones I’ve seen, which are only a very fucking few, were.”
Railine continued, “Anyway, everything was looking good.  Aria, you, and myself had passed, and the idea, even if utterly misguided by your comment, was validated as it showed a difference in Rox and Laina.  We finally had something to go off of, and now they are all dead and gone.”
“Heh…so much for that or those bitches.”
Ryla’s words were slow,.  “Aria …had the blood paks…”  Ryla pointed to the collapsed ceiling that would be the grave for their comrades.
“Hmm?”
Railine had a grim look on his face as he realized what she was implying.,  “Tthe medical box of themblood paks…it had most of them, and now it’s smashed in there., it was most of them.  Smashed in there.”
Solide looked away,; both were surprised he did not swear.  “Definitely so much for that.”
Railine pulled out two small red vials,.  “I have two from earlier.  O, one was for Ryla, and the other was for when Aria decided to do her own.,”  Has he looked at Ryla.
“Are you going to test me?” s She asked.
“I was going to, once.”  Railine did not say anything else.
“Test her,.”   Solide said with an iciness that belied his earlier comforting of her.
“Solide!  Why?”  She staggered back from him.  She looked at Railine who did not smile back at her either.
“Too many died to Elyria Modality,” Solide continued.  “.  I judged by appearance then, I won’t make that mistake again.”  His words brought instant tears to her face.
“I thought we were friends!  I thought you cared about me!  I hate needles, I hate blood, I hate VIOLENCE!”
“You pass and we are back to friends.  It’s nothing personal.”  
As Railine watched, he had a dark respect for Solide in his ability to separate emotions.  “We can, but there is a problem,” he Railine said, rattlingrattled the two vials in his hand.
“But…but…” she wasRyla stammereding.  H, how could she possible resist these two?  She was panicking and not seeing the potential escape in Railine’s words.
“Those are the last fucking ones, aren’t they?” Solide asked.
Railine nodded. , “It is.  ReNew paks likely would work as well, but…”  ReNew paks were so expensive, and so valuable that it was as ifsimilar to asking someone if they would trade their life to you.  In a way, that’s what they were capable of.  On fringe worlds like this everyone was assigned one they kept with them almost always - you didn’t get a second one.
“If we blow a blood pak on her, if anyone comes back, we only have one left for them.”
Solide turned away. , “When she Death Angel’s your ass, you’ll think back to this.”
“I am not a Death Angel!”  Ryla threw her hands down to her side as she pleaded.
“I think both are of you are trust worthy,” Railine said,.  “When Laina revealed herself, either of you could have attacked and that would have been the end of us.”
“How cute.”
Railine looked back at him firmly.,  “Not really.  When Laina attacked, Ryla dove into me sparing me the attack that killed Aria.  You came in and picked both of us up.  Either one of you could have left me to die.”
Solide breathed in deep, thought about saying something, and but let it out in a quick breath.
Railine bent down, adjusting part of the nano repair block he had and set it to the floor.  It turned into a pile of goop and slowly slid away as it started cleaning up the char off the floor.  Solide kicked a burnt piece of furniture away from him,; the entire room was black and really pissing him off.  “One thing I have to say, is your friend saved us another way by breaking that freeze over us.”
“What?”  Railine asked.
“Those…things mess with our minds somehow.  Maybe it’s the fact they look so close to us but so disturbingly off and deadly; or just outright mind control, but we both felt it .  Nothing personal, but a civ like you being frozen might be expected, but you seem pretty capable in a crisis.  To have both of us absolutely frozen?”  Solide shrugged.  “Only other time that ever happened was when I encountered them in the past.  That’s what makes me think they fuck with our minds on some level.  It didn’t expect Aria to attack her again, and it disrupted her enough we could break out and attack back.”
“What do we do if something like that comes again?”
“Whoever it isn’t facing, attacks it.”  He smirked at his next point,.  “Rreally gives a new dimension to teamwork when everyone else is relying on you to trigger that thing’s wrath to unfreeze the others.”
“What about her?”  Railine asked, pointing to the girl with the ribbon in her hair.
“She is part of the team, and she’ll do her part if it comes to it.”
“I don’t like violence,” she said.
“I don’t fucking care.”  He Solide bent down, swung a backpack he had on around in front of him and dug through it, pulling out a thin block.  He clicked the button as two slides popped out, then both of these rolled upwards slightly as a few more things snapped into place, unfolding as it unfolded into a pulse rifle.  “Ryla.,”  hHe nodded and tossed her the weapon.
She caught it out of reflex, saw what it was, and dropped it to the floor.  “I can’t.”
“You better change that.”
“I can’t.”
“Pick up the damn gun!” h He yelled at her.
“No!”
He yelled even louder. , “Pick up the fucking gun!”  He walked over and grabbed her wrist firmly,.  “Do you have any fucking idea what is happening right now, little girl?”  The size difference between them was obvious.
“I’d rather die than ever use one of these again!”  Tears were dripping down her prideful face and she yanked her wrist out of his hand.
“Why?”  Railine asked her, without Solide’s anger.
“Like I would tell either of you two killers!”
Railine was silent for a while. , “Until Beside this thing and the monster earlier, I had never consciously killed another being.  Your comment is misplaced.”
“Do you care about us?”  Solide asked.
“I hardly know him, and I thought I cared about you,.” Ryla bluntly answered.
Solide bent down, grabbing the rifle and presenting it to her.  “I’m sure something bad happened, maybe your family got killed because of a gun, I’ve seen it before.  I won’t apologize because I didn’t do it, but there is a good chance we are going to need you.”
She shook her tearful face. , “I won’t.”
“You won’t help?”
“I won’t use a weapon.  I can still help you.”
He scoffed., “How?”
“I am not scared of fighting.”
“You just said you won’t fucking use a weapon!”  Through Solide’s words, Railine could tell he was ‘tiring of her stupidity’.  “Every other word is that you hate violence!  What the fuck!”
“I can draw fire.  I can save you guys.  I can…feel attacks, I can see them coming.”
Solide paused, and likely wondered the same thing Railine was thinking.  Solide asked, “Senses?”
She nodded slowly, as if the admission would cause them to spring at her.  “I think so.”
“You think you have Psionics?”  Railine tried to clarify.
Her nod was very slow.  In some parts places people like that were discriminated against, but in general they were not.  Here it was a huge boon if it could save them.
“If you fuck up even once you are getting the damn gun.”  She nodded solemnly.
Railine thought back to the wall of fire as he hosed Laina and little Ryla doing her best to tackle the big man out of the way of the surprise attack that would have killed him.  Somehow she knew what was coming through with absolutely zero visual indication.
He looked back once at the smashed grave of his quiet friend Aria who’se random attack on Laina had saved perhaps all of them.  ‘Thank you, Aria.’ He made the Return Circle out of one hand, as he started by his forehead, swung down to his stomach and back to his head before bringing it down to his heart - in deference to his friend who apparently had Star Priestess ties somewhere in her past.  ‘Goddess, may you speed the Departed’s return to the Line.’  If he made it out of this, he would learn much more about the Star Priestesses for his dead friend’s sake.  A regret hung in his heart about how quickly he maligned her, and abandoned trust for someone that was there for him in the ultimate way.
Heading out of the hallway Solide called after him, “What are you doing now?”
“Well, grabbing more fuel for the Jetstream first.  Then we bunker in, kill what we have to, figure out what we can, and wait to see if the others come back.”  He fished the two vials out of his pocket,.  “Two left.”
Solide stuck the rifle on in a pouch on his backpack behind his head.  “If I’m right, only one of them will be back.  It’s that fucking slut pilot.  We don’t test, we just shoot, got that?”
“Feyria is nice,” Ryla defended her friend who was teaching her how to fly the aerial vehicles better.  Teaching her a lifetime ago, it seemed.
“They can act.  Did you learn nothing from Laina?”
Railine walked out, his heart was hardening to the new reality he was in.  “It doesn’t matter.  Whoever comes back, we test.  I, if they refuse we shoot them.”
“Good.  That’s what it takes to live.”
“I thought you were peaceful,” Ryla said to him.
“Circumstances have changed.”  Railine felt old in his eyes, like he had seen the world a million times over already.
“He likes the feel of death,” Solide commented as he smiled darkly at him.
Railine looked at Solide coldly. , “I am not like you.  I derive no pleasure from killing.  This is arrived at from a cold logic.”
“I don’t give a fuck what you think.  T, the only thing that matters is that you’ are ready to fight for your life.”
Railine looked at him and thought about saying ‘of course’ but he was tired of talking and simply walked out.  He was with a hardened killer and a dumb little girl who may or may not have Psionic abilities.  His only real friends were Madigan and Aria.  Aria was dead, crushed and burned under the rubble of the room he was leaving, and all discussion suggested Madigan was likewise dead and they would be seeing a single ‘infected’ person returning back – initially acting innocent.
He fingered the two vials in his pocket under his armor.  Thinking back to a Stoic quote about standing tall while the ruins of the world and fate fell around you, he doubted they ever truly meant in such a situation like this.
Feeling very heavy suddenly, he sat down against the wall.  He thought back to Aria, her soft face and long hair.  She did not talk much but was such a kind woman.  He looked to the side at the burnt out room that was slowly getting cleaned by the nano block, but could not take his eyes off the inglorious grave his friend was in.  He started crying, realizing he would never see her gentle smile again.  All his stoicism was a coping mechanism for the loneliness everyone found themselves in.
He had met one of a few people he could bond with, and she lay crushed in the next room over.  Dying to an alien force.  Resting his head on his crossed arms between his knees the tears started coming harder.  “Aria…”  he whimpered her name out, and its pathetic sound made him feel even worse as he cried harder.
Another girl he cared about so much, consumed by fire.

 
Feyria
Day-3, Morning
Location: Ancient Ship

Feyria woke up, confused where she was.  A, after thrashing a bit, pain came back to her, and frozen ice on her eyebrows and hair slowly reminded her what had happened.  She had been shot by Kalco  and had passed out here.  The nanites in her saved her, but she likely would not live for long without any additional help.  There was one person left she wanted to talk to and began crawling down the slope towards him.
If she tried using her legs it hurt her stomach too much, but using her elbows she could drag herself without too much issue.  The emotions in her were strong enough that a lot of her physical pain was blocked out.
She liked Kalco so much but in the end was disappointed he could not comprehend what was at stake here.  It was sad, but not unexpected.  H, he was a physical presence and what you saw with him was about as deep as it got.  He could never understand that he might not be the good guy, and even said as much.
To her it was quite clear all Solarian striving was nothing except foolishness.  Like the poet had once said, a tale of sound and fury, told by an idiot, signifying nothing.
She lowered her head, taking a few breaths.  His skills were good.  E, even getting the jump on him, he had won, but she didn’t fear death.  She half-heartedly believed in the Line, well that her essence was going to make it in, any way.  It was quite clear as things were developing that it was real.  She had accepted what was her role was, a link in a long chain.  She was a piece in a grand puzzle that was slowly coming to completion.
Methodically she put one elbow in front of the other as she crawled through the mist that had returned to the room.  It was not nearly as dense now that the ship had warmed up.  This is where they had encountered the Death Angel and Zaier was hit and began to change.  They had talked some, and what they had talked about confirmed what she believed.
She had made it to the bridge, and at this point had little energy to continue and put her face down and thought to herself.  She thought about the times Kalco held her, the way he was physically dominate, pushing her body down or picking it up, having his way with her.  He seemed conflicted that he was cheating on Laina with her, but as since she was not tied to anyone she had no compunctions about it.  Further, she thought his own issue was somewhat silly as morality was so meaningless and served only to chain those who embraced it.
Zaier was different when they were together;, he had a cold methodology to him.  It was a good pairing as it enabled a deviant side both of them possessed as he liked taking the pain of something in his soul out on Feyria who really liked being the bad girl who was punished.  It was one of the few ways she felt alive in a world of falsehood.
“Zaier…” she moaned out.
She thought about the chain link idea some more.  Being AGEd, a lineage of births was no longer appropriate, but thought of up to the point of Aelisha engineering that the DNA she had in her was a long line of successes.  Each father and mother had mated, having a child that also would pass on DNA.  It was easy to think of think them as old and dead.  But once they had been like her, young, alive with dreams and desires.
If she could someonehow see every one of them, lined up at their prime, holding hands with their parent and also their off spring it would be a long, long chain.  A single one of them breaking meant everyone beyond never existing.  Such a strange unlikelihood that she existed at all despite the odds.  AGEd coming in changed things, but at some level her base DNA went through such a winnowing as this.
Any one of them might be meaningless, but in a way held vast power as they enabled all that came after them.
Feyria would not be passing any genes on, dying on this icy planet, and at this point was unsure she had really done anything that her ancestors might not hate for never doing despite the long link leading to her.
A cold male voice spoke, “You are still alive.”
She lifted her head, and hope filled her heart seeing Zaier.  “Glad you are alive .”
He walked over, his jacket was not on any longer and it was his body .no longer wearing any clothing on his upper half and allowing Feyria to see his bare torso.  Compared to the thicker, larger Kalco, Zaier was thin and lithe.  His arms scooped under her, and easily shifted her to a sitting position and he sat down next to her.
“Is it that hot?  I can’t really tell,” she asked him.
“Temperature doesn’t aeffect me anymore.”
She looked at him,.  “Your shoulder.…”
The area he had been hit and was looking worse and worse, especially as it rejected Solarian medical technology.  The wound was now closed and healed.  The various heads  of his deltoid were visible when he would subtly move his arm.
“I understand my place in things now.  My essence was always bound for this.”
“I am happy for you.”
Zaier put his hand on Feyria’s knee, shaking it very softly as he rubbed it.
Feyria continued, “When I saw that Death Angel, I realized something, and that we were wrong in a way.  That was a pinnacle being, and our resistance of it was unnatural.  What we value is so small and minute,; we could never hope to understand the working of the universe.  I had realized that when I was a young girl.  There was no real value we could hope to objectively find, the only purpose of our existence was to give it a value.”
“Existentialism?”  Zaier asked.  He knew Feyria was far smarter than she played, and was decently literate.
“No,” she giggled pitifully, “nothing more than a hedonism really.  Everything is relative from our point of view.  Or at least there is no way to objectively know.  Any sacrifice for something we can’t truly know was dumbstupid.  I never denied myself pleasure, and for that I feel like I lived a truer life than most.”
Zaier lifted up his hand, and in front of the air a pink glass blade formed.,  Feyria watched it silently as he flung it across the abyss and it embedded in the far wall.  “From my perspective it’s clear what I need to do.  I have to maintain the natural order.”
Near death, a show like that didn’t surprise her.  “Was that because you got hit?  Are you one of those things?”
“Yes.  T, the life essence we are composed of resonated with that being’s.  It is what I always was, or could become.”
She put her hand on her stomach, trying to reduce the pain.  “Can you turn me into one?  I might like it.”
Zaier shook his head slowly.,  “It is not that simple.”
She leaned forward quickly.,  “But I am sympathetic!”  The pain forced her back.
“I know.”  Zaier turned his head away.
Feyria closed her eyes.,  “Maybe the long chain I am from, my purpose was simply to help you.”
Zaier had leaned into her, pulling her towards him.  H, her head rested on his shoulder and her long hair fell down his back.  “I do not consider myself ‘the good guy’.  The concept is far too simplistic.”
“I know,” Feyria said.
“That is what impressed me about you when we were talking earlier.  Your value was in the life you lived,.  I liked that, with the assumption no one could know truth.  It was novel, a subtle touch on existentialism even if you don’t admit it.”
“Keep…talking.  I like it.”
There was something that sounded very simple but had profound implication.  “The title name of what I am going to ask you will show its dated history, but are you familiar with ‘my grandfather’s axe?’”  Feyria shook her head ‘no’.,  “How about the Ship of Thessus?’”
“No.”
“Maybe I gave you too much credit for being smart.”
She coughed a bit,.  “Don’t be mean to me now.”
“The title’s names aren’t too important right now.  Let me explain.  A, are you the same Feyria you were as a child?”
“No.  I have changed.”
Zaier paused,.  “That answer surprises me.  To extrapolate, take a vehicle like your V-Plane.  I, if you have to replace the engine, change the cockpit around some, and over the duration of your tour here eventually every piece is changed, repaired or re-fabricated.  I, is that still the same V-Plane?”
“No,.” s She answered simply.  Zaier had a long laughing session to himself.  “What?”
“I agree.  I am pleasantly amused you believe the same thing.  Many do not.”
“They’re dumb.”
He scoffed, “Perhaps.”
Feyria’s finger slowly moved up and down Zaier’s toned chest.  H, her face was looking down, maybe the smallest beginnings of a tear in themher eyes.  She moved upwards and touched thea black shape pendant on his necklace.  It was like two horizontal bars with angles coming off of it.  “You never told me what this was from.”
“It was a girl I was close with, she gave it to me.”
“That’s all?  Give me the girl version.,”  Hher eyes were heavy, and his body felt warm.
Zaier did not seem annoyed;, in her final moments he was understanding.  “I was what you might call an assassin.  T, there was a girl I was partner’s with for a very long time.  She was unlike you in every way beyond a physical attraction I had for both.  She had a morose, mournful style to her.  In my field, people ended up there one of three ways.  First,, they were born or created into it;, those were always the most unnerving as they lacked any social grace at all.  Then there were the type that demonstrated superior skill and recruited into it;, that was my path.  And lLast are pickups or refuges;, a decent fraction caome that way.  Usually a colony or something bombed out and only had a few survivors.  O, often they have various Psionics that had become manifested from surviving their hardship and are useful as since they no connection and are easy to write off as dead.  I think she was one of those.”
“That’s sad.”  Feyria was almost drifting off to a final sleep, her hand had fallen in his lap.  He held it with his and said nothing about it.
“She was slow to open up. , I liked her because in my field I wasn’t around many people any more.   and Tto have a woman like her who provided a cerebral challenge to figure out my attraction seemed evident to develop .  Hery behavior was very circumspect but she had come to enjoy my presence.  One night we spent an emotional time together on a cliff over looking a city and she gave me that necklace, asking me only to ‘remember’.”  He stopped for a while.,  “Unfortunately, the next mission went back,d and she died.  I was pulled off those missions and eventually ended up here.  It was one of the few failures in my life.”
“You wear it…as a cross to bear?” s She asked, trying to stay awake.  Stay alive.
“No, nothing like that.  Just an emblem of a promise I made to her that I would remember.  It left my heart cold for a long time.  I guess telling you this story brings back things I had suppressed, but our conversation actually makes me feel closer to you.  Tragic, given the way this has occurred.”
He shook her a bit and she talkedspoke, “I helped you…because it seemed natural.”
“You possess an awareness few do.  From here, it is quite evident that what I need to do is the natural order.  The others represent a disorder, a challenge to existence.”
“Don’t…really follow.”
He rubbed her head.  , “Iit is okay.  I know more now, but my knowledge is still woefully incomplete.  It is likely we might be  meet again.”
“Do I…remember?”
“I…am not sure,.” h He answered truthfully.
“I need to know…will you love me again?”
“Perhaps in a way more than you might imagine.”  
Feyria was happy to hear that and slowly drifted away while Zaier held the womaen he loved in a way mortals could not understand.




 
Railine
Day-3, Midday
Location: Reiko-10 Bunkered room

Railine
Location: Reiko-10, Bunkered room

Railine looked to the side on a wall where five slash marks were carved into the steel.  “It’s been five cycles since (xxx check this not sure its right) this has started.  O, our current path is not ultimately sustainable.”  Five nights they had survived the snow, the cold, and the creatures.
“We are doing okay, all things considered.”  Ryla had swung her backpack back around her lightweight body armor she had acquired.  She had stuck true to her promise of not wanting to use weapons, but proved herself useful as support for the two fighters.  She picked up healing fairly fast, and was adaptable with the nano blocks as more and more of the base was repaired metal.
Demonstrating a deeper loyalty to the small team, she had willingly implanted a neural chip inside her head that helped track movement.  It impressed Railine that her already potent power of being watchful was taken to a higher level by being amplified by technology.  Neural chip implants were not that strenuous of a surgery despite the fact it was tunneled into the skull.  Kalco  and Solide stood by while she had it done, the small girl unconscious for a small period of time as the machines sliced open her skull and slid in the tiny chip.
They were designed to be adaptable right away, as nanites in the brain along with the chip interact and striung new neurons in a very true cyborg fashion.  Not that the natural ICS system was much different but neural chips were a much steeper commitment as they did not take long to put in, but could never been taken out as they became too interwoven with brain tissue.  Not very easily anyway,; no one here knew for sure one way or another.
“‘It’s okay, I want to protect you guys,”’ she had said not long ago.  When the short operation was done, she would have that chip in her until the day she died.  T, the only other option was to upgrade to advanced version which were was rare and expensive.
The three of them had constructed slightly different bunker shapes in the main room, rearranging what furniture they could, making them only facing out towards each of the four main halls rather than the entire circular embankment it once was.  Solide was using some tools he had took taken from the workshop, his as he had his gun ‘Claim Jumper’ torn taken apart and was puttingas he installed a rail inductor upgrade onto it.  “We have come a long way.  Y, you two can actually hold your own.”
Ryla had three small pieces of metal she was flipping with her left thumb.  Her eyes darted quickly between them as she was expertly juggleding them in a small circle in the air, catching them perfectly on her nail before flipping it back into the air.  It was somewhat entrancing just to watch.
“That’s pretty uncanny.  You ever used to be able to do that?”  Railine asked her.
With a fast grab from her right hand she caught all three mid air, turning to look at him as she let out a small laugh. , “Nno never.  I wasn’t uncoordinated exactly, but imagine the shy girl who gets hit in the face by the gravball during gym and that was me.”
The two of them laughed, sharing a rare moment of ease amidst the likely deadly struggle.  
“I loved smashing those types,” Solide said.
“Is that pun intended?”  Ryla asked, he laughed.  “I didn’t doubt you were that kind either.  Funny the circumstance we end up in now,” Ryla said.
Railine began asking, “Are they messing with your Psionics at all?”
“ ‘Psionics’, I hate that fucking term,” Solide said, racking the rail tight against the gun rapidly being complete.
Railine turned towards him.,  “That’s what the term is.”
“Yeah, if you are in some fucking lab.  E, everyone else just calls them Senses.”
Railine looked back to Ryla and the two of them had a small grin on.  She explained, “Surprisingly, no.  The chip helps with my processing speed.  I, it’s like everything just occurs a fraction slower.  I still feel the hostile intent, it isbut it’s like I can see the attack before it occurs.”
“What’s that like?” h He asked.  There was a girl he was close with once, similar to Ryla in not many ways beyond being kind and demonstrating extra ability.
“Kind of like a dream,” the words triggered a memory for Railine, “but different, more of a gut-feeling.”
Railine picked up his Jetstream off the table, taking a quick look to make sure the fuel level was topped off and the pilot light was still on, and sat it back down.  “You know, when this whole thing began, I thought for a moment I had Psionics for a bit there.”
Ryla went back to flipping her small metal pieces. , “Wwhy?”
“I thought I saw it in a dream.  Right around when Rox was shot, I saw it before.  I knew some of the sentences, but then it got derailed.”
“So…you thought you were special then found out you weren’t.”  That was Solide while completing the upgrade.
Railine laughed.  H, he had started to come around to the way Solide wasy, similar to Madigan in that their latent self-hate manifested by pushing others away from them.  “Not sure.  Ryla, is that what it’ is like?  I could hear the words people were about to speak before they did, theyn something would subtly change and I would be confused again.  Something new would happen again and I would be back to the vid I was watching.  Only lasted a bit, but never returned.”
She put the pieces down to not be rude as she talked.  “No, not like that.  For one thing it’s never words, not for me anyway.  It’s not like I am watching a vid, it’s more like I am sitting here and then I am completely sure you or Solide is going to grab that gun and shoot me.”
“Heh, at least you included his ass. , I’d feel discriminated against otherwise.”  He lifted his shotgun, racked the slide a few times, and smiled to himself and as he slipped an ammo block through the lower port.  It made a zipping type sound as the caseless ammo was merged into the reservoir and the small parts of the block fell to the ground.
“Yeah…it wasn’t like that.”
Solide then asked Ryla, “Are you a Priestess by chance?”
Ryla looked shocked as she moved her head back,.  “Me?  Are you serious?”
“I know you aren’t.,”  hHe pointed to his face, then to his wrist,.  “You’re lacking both of the tell-tale signs.  You have the Aelisha slave sign like the rest of us.”
Ryla lowered her eyes,.  “I met one once, but no way.  They are so kind, and gentle.  They always know what to do, always know what to say.  They are intelligent…”
“And hot,” Solide added.
“And impeccable,.”  Railine added.
“Which I guess disqualifies her,” Solide said poking Ryla.
“Hey!”
The three of them all had a little laugh together.
“Those women always have way jacked out Senses,” Solide explained.  “Not sure if it’s birth, or AGEd shit going on or what, but having worked along side some, they creep me the fuck out.,”  Hhe looked at the two people he was with, making sure they didn’t think he was getting soft. , “Aas much as I’d want to fuck ‘em.”
“I can assume you just aren’t just some lowly guard.”
Solide stood back, crossing him arms as he leaned against a wall.  “Nope.  I was a Classed, still am I guess but fuck that.  Mine was Assault in case you didn’t fucking know.  T, the things we’d do would blow your mind.  The amount of aliens I have killed is staggering, all to keep you guys safe.”
“Is that last part sarcasm?”  Railine asked.
He shook his head. , “Not really.  I believed in what I was doing, likely a fair amount due to endless indoctrination of course, but what we were doing was for the betterment of the Solarian race.  I am not going to pretend that I was the ‘good guy’ or a hero or anything, because some of it is pretty fucked up, but from the viewpoint of our race over others, I never wavered.”
Ryla looked concerned,.  “Something changed,.  I can tell how much hate you hold.”
“To start with, the lovely Star Priestesses, oh and they are quite lovely let me tell you,” he became distracted by some tale of glory. , “I only fucked one of them.  I, it was pretty amazing as far as that goes, you always know how hot they are, honed by endless fitness…”  hHe voice trailed off before he then pointed to his head. , “Bbut they do things to your mind.”
Railine looked disturbed. , “This is a side I never heard before.”  He was also taking this with a grain of salt;, a lot of people make things up.  Given the subject matter especially.
“For being a Classed, my Senses were on the lower end. , I had the three main combat Senses at fair levels of course, but that was it.  You ever hear of the ‘rape Sense’?”  
Railine shook his head ‘no’.  He very well might have if Solide ever used a proper name. 
“It’s slang Classeds use a lot, since we are around SPs all the time.  I’ am not sure if it’s controllable, they claim it is, but of course they’d say that, but they can probe your mind.  Can see your memories and shit.  When I was with that one, it was hot at first when she knew exactly everything I wanted and she catered to it, but I was left disturbed after when I was in a more rational frame of mind.  It’ is a long story, but she basically saw I was part of something I claimed I wasn’t, and it could have taken me down hard.”
Ryla looked confused. , “Why are you upset then?  Your special friend spared you.”
Solide laughed heartily. , “ ‘Special Friend’, I like that.  Oh she spared me, but I think it’s cause I saved her ass off that planet.  She had a loyalty to the organization.  S, she really should have told someone that she knew, but let me off.  I consider ourselves us even, but it left me really wary of these women around me with unseen power.”
Railine lifted his right hand, toggling an adjustment on his armor.  I, it loosened slightly over his left arm and felt much better.  He rolled his arm a few times and was content with the adjustment.  “Could you still get in trouble?”
“No.  Too much stuff has happened.  I, it was mostly the lesson that scarred me.  Then Elyria happened, and that’s where I became disillusioned.  O, oh and guess what?”  Before anyone answered, “Mr. Squad Leader Kalco was there.”
Both of the other’s mouths dropped open.  It was loosely understood that no one knew each other here with perhaps the exception of maybe Kalco and Laina since they had been here on a long rotation.  
He nodded.,  “Story for another day, but I was one of the few left in my squad when his came for backup.  Almost all of us got wiped.  W, we were the only two who lived, though I doubt he knows I did, considering.”  He laughed at something no one else knew. , “I owe the fucker a lot,.  I can’t stand him a lot of the time, but I owe him my life.”
Railine asked to clarify something he didn’t understand, “But why do you not interact with him,?  I have never seen anything between you guys.”
He laughed. , “Let’s say some things have changed.  Regardless, I was so pissed off about being sent on a suicide mission I…took it out on quite a few people.  I got caught, I was given a choice, and now I am here.”  To Solide’s story, Railine knew even if it was true, very much was being left out.  “Bastards.  Ironic from my view, really.  The bodies are going to pile again if I ever get out of here .”
The dark admission sent the room in silence.  After a while Railine spoke up, “Anyway, what were we even talking about?”
Ryla answered. , “Nothing really.  I really enjoyed this conversation, I feel like I got to see a new side to you guys.”
Railine agreed, “I have enjoyed it, too.”  Ryla was looking near where the collapsed roof was, staring at it oddly.  “What?”
“I am probably way wrong, given the room’s been cleaned, and we re-arranged everything, but wasn’t Rox’s body closer to the wall?”
Railine turned to look andconsider what she was saying,.  “I don’t know, it was pretty close to where the edge of that is.”
“I’m not sure.  I, it definitely seemed like it was outside of the collapse.”
Railine gritted his teeth.  H, he didn’t agree but if she was right, somehow the body was gone .
Solide yelled to the two of them. , “I thought about that already.  No one say lived given the fire in there.  We aren’t sure if they leave bodies, it’s like they fucking burn up.  The bigger ones?  Who knows.”
“Maybe.  R, regardless, she would have attacked if she wasn’t.”  Railine was convinced of the reason.  “Anyway we still have to decide what to do here/,”  Railine pointed to his fingers as he counted.,  “One, there is no contact with another any other base, and given Seven, I think we know why.  Two, our other group may or may not be alive.  Three, any space resupply is not going to be coming for a long time, meaning no help.  Four, I don’t know how much longer we can survive.”
“Did you guys notice any vehicles at Seven7?”  Solide asked.
Railine put his hand on his chin, thinking back to something that seemed so long ago.  “Don’t think so, but we landed on the other side, or wait…was Seven7 a mirror of ours?”
“Why are you asking?”
Solide turned to answer Ryla, “Well, we aren’t leaving with anything here.  Was wondering if they had something that could get to space.”
“We have the bike, which only two can take, and we have the APC, if we want to leave the base.  We have tThe Gyro-copter, but without Madigan or Feyria.…”
“Fuck Feyria, I can fly it .”  They looked at the lowly guard.  
“I thought you were a soldier?”
“I was.  T, they gave us some training in that.  I, if the pilot got capped, the whole mission couldn’t be compromised.”
Railine shrugged,.  “Good to know, but all bases from my knowledge came equipped the same.  The only thing that could make it would maybe be the V-Plane but I don’t know the specifics.”
“No.,”  Tthe two men looked at the young woman as she spoke.,  “I am pretty sure not.  The V-Plane is based on Impulse drives, not Grav.  A, assuming it was even space-worthy, I don’t think it could fly.”
Railine sat against the wall, crossing his arms,.  “Well, what do we do?”
“If we stay, we die.”  They had been fighting for a while.  L, low level stims keeping them going, but they could not stay awake forever.  An attack here or there could ruin them, and if a Death Angel came they were all likely dead.
“If we leave, we probably die,” Ryla said back.
No one answered her, both lost in their own thoughts.  They were rRelatively safe in the base excluding whatever it was Laina that was.  T, they could last a while, but to what avail?  Reiko-10 was not a base built to withstand enemy attacks, thus the multitude of doors everywhere.  Even barricading did not matter as these creatures seemed strong enough to bust the door down like the vehicle bay.  It was easier to just let them in and fight them rather than risk permanent damage to the structure.
Her words were quiet and slow, “I am just so tired…,”  Railine lifted his head to look at her, then lowered his head once again.  The words remindeding him how tired he was himself.
“Ryla, why don’t you take a quick nap, do a forced sleep.,”  He spread his fingers by his wrist and a holographic pad appeared.  H, he plugged in a time and sent it over to Ryla.  “When you wake up Solide and I can each take a turn or two for all of us.”  The time equivalence of about half an hour would be enough to let the brain rest and reset enough to press on.
“What about if we’ are attacked?”
“Then we will wake you up,.”  Railine joked, but the fatigue was wearing on him.  It was a testament to Ryla in a lot of ways;, Railine was tough, and Solide was some special soldier, and she hadn’t complained at all while hanging with them. 
“Do it.  We all need sleep.”
She looked down, then back up, nodding assent while all three headed towards the living quarters.  Ryla went inside her room while the two men sat down against the walls of the hallway.
Railine didn’t feel like talking much anymore, and gratefully neither did Solide.  He sat there thinking about their options, none of which were good.   With nearly five full cycles gone and not a word from the other team it was pretty evident they were dead.  So long ago Zaier had noted if they were not proactive they would all die.  I, it was seeming true, but they were dying anyway.
Heading off seemed logical but it was hard to not think of repeating the same mistake  the earlier group had.  Still, he looked backed at the main room which was now clean of ash, excluding the crushed metal roof near the center,; here it was only a matter of time.
After the allotted time elapsed, Ryla came out, pawing at one of her eyes with her palm.  “You’re next,” Solide said to him.
There was a moment when Railine wondered if this was a good idea.  H, he knew he wasn’t going to betray the two of them, but Ryla had not been tested, and even if Solide was Solarian it didn’t mean he wasn’t a murderer.  He thought about ICSing Ryla, but her loyalty was towards Solide more than himself, so there was nothing to do really.  If either wanted to kill him, they could have in the past, and still could now but without sleep they would die eventually.
He headed into his own room, hit the bed, keyed a forced sleep, and was out immediately.
Before he knew it, he was awake in a dark room, wondering where he was.  He felt , feeling a bit tranquil before it all came back to him the nightmare he was still in.  Heading out, he nodded to Solide.  N, no words were exchanged and the other man headed in.
Even that short amount went a long way to restoring his senses.  He was nNo closer to coming up with an answer to the large question of how to get out of here though.
Solide completed his nap, Ryla started the second cycle, and all three of them got two naps in.  Ryla was asleep for a third while the two men were silently sitting in the hallway guarding the sleeping girl when an ICS broke through that changed nearly everything.
This is Kalco, I am returning on the V-Plane is anyone left alive?  - Kalco 
Railine’s eyes shot wide and, Solide looked just as surprised.  Railine was about to respond when he caught himself thinking about the idea and waiting.  Solide had shot forward, putting a finger over his mouth and shaking his head ‘no’.
“Get Ryla,” Solide said in a whisper.  It was perhaps ironic as since a whisper was not needed at all, but in moment secrecy was now needed.
Railine went into the girl’s room as the light softly turned on.  T, there was a scrolling picture on her desk of her with shorter hair and a group of friends at an academy somewhere.  The next one showed her smiling as she held her completion certificate.  He shook the small woman,.  “Ryla…,”  sShe slowly stirred and woke up.
“Whaa…?”
His deadly serious face snapped her to attention,.  “Someone is back.  I, it’s Kalco.”
She shot awake, and the two of them headed out to the hallway.	
This is Kalco, I am returning on the V-Plane is anyone left alive?  - Kalco repeated again.
“No one answer him.  If he is friendly we can make it up.  C, come on.,”  Solide led the way as the three of them went over to the weapon’s locker, which shared a door outside towards the landing strip.  They stood at the door as they saw the V-Plane’s bright light cutting through the blizzard outside.  It dumped it’s excess speed on the runway as it slid into the hangar.  They could not see anything for a moment then a curious thing came out: Kalco on the Lift Bike. 
Instead of heading the short  distance to the weapon locker, he swung wide and was gone out of sight.
“Well…now what?”
Solide did not answer him, merely saying, “Heh, interesting.”
“Did either of you two see anyone else?”  The snow was bad, but the distance was not that great.  S, she knew the answer but merely needed it confirmed.
“So far, no.,”  Railine stayed glued to the window.  After five long cycles, someone had finally come back.  He was eager to hear what information they had, and if anyone else was left alive.  The mystery deepened when he just headed straight out without anything said.
“You guys remember what I said about only one survivor right?”  Solide asked.  Railine nodded grimly.  H, he had not considered it at the time as the likely outcome but now it stared them in the face.  The suspicion was simply far too high, given what they experienced with Rox and Laina.
“Someone else has to be…”  Ryla did not sound convinced, then doubled down on her statement.,  “Someone else is alive.”
Both Solide and Railine held their weapons ready.  It had been a bit of time since an alien attack, and now they may be facing down whatever these higher creatures were.  The single redeeming fact seemed to be that it was only Solarian females, but that was not completely confirmed.
“Doesn’t look like it,” Solide answered.  They waited and waited for a second figure out of the hangar, but nothing.
Ryla shook her head, the ribbon she still had on trailed the motion;, it was one of the last cute things left in this darkness.  “Kalco can’t fly.”
The words hit both of the other men.
Solide had looked at her, then back to the door,.  “You’re right…what the fuck?”
“He might have killed them, or maybe they are wounded, we need to check.,”  Railine reached for the door handle, but Solide stopped him.
“I don’t think that’s a good idea.”
“Kalco left, if we stay together we are safe.  We need to know, this will answer a lot of questions.”
Solide closed his eyes for a second, nodded,.  “Yeah, it actually will tell us if we shoot that fucker on sight.”
Together they ripped open the door that had started to get piled with snow even with the repulsers working and ran over to the hangar.  The V-Plane and Gyro-Copter hung there silently.
Railine had slung the flame thrower over his shoulder, letting the pilot light dangle safely away and had brandished his axe as he peeked in the Copter. , “Clear here.”  Not that they expected otherwise.
“Stay close, but only swing that shit if I am no where close, got it?”  Solide asked him before heading into the V-Plane.  Ryla stayed behind them but to the outside.  Railine followed the fighter inwards to the dark cockpit.
Soldier kept one hand on the trigger as he waved his hand and the light in the main cabin came on.  Railine tightened his grip, ready for anything to launch at him, or a splatter of bodies.
“It’s empty,” Ryla said, peeking around Railine.
Solide rapidly turned to the right, kicking the cockpit door open and holding his shotgun steady.  Railine dashed into the middle of the aisle, ready to back him up, but then was confused when he lowered his weapon.
“This shit just gets weirder.”  He pointed to the seat as, the other two came in.  Both of the pilot seats were empty.
Railine confirmed with Ryla, “You said Kalco can’t fly right?”
She nodded. , “No way.  The V-Plane isn’t something you can just pick up.  I had a lot of flight classes because my role as a comm. officer I needed to know at least how to fly in basic terms in case I needed to guide a crash landing or something.  I had that basics that Feyria could work with me, but you’d need to be good like her or Madigan.”
Solide shoved his way between the two in a hurry and left the plane;, they looked confused and followed him out.
He started laughing.,  “I was wWorried maybe it was a trap.  That little fuck.  He is so dead.”
“Solide, I need a serious answer here.  Y, you said you know how to pilot the copter.  G, given I know nothing about any of these, is it likely Kalco could have been trained to fly this?”
Ryla was about to answer, but the harsh look on Railine’s face told her to shut up.
“No way.”
Railine wasn’t happy with the answer.,  “Why not?”
“He was a Leader class.  T, they are versed in basics across the board but mostly its tactics, movement, positions, procurement, evasion, that sort of thing.”
Railine was pushing hard,.  “Ryla said she had basics of grav flight, why wouldn’t he?”
“It’s an impulse engine,” she matter-of-factly stated.  The two men looked at her as it seemed useless to what they were currently talking about.
“Easy, we don’t use these things on missions, no way he would have had to know it.  If he was an Intel, or maybe Sniper…maybe, and that’s a huge fucking maybe.”
“You know how to fly,” Ryla said.,  “Why are we judging him?”
“Yeah, the Gyro-Copter,” Solide responded.,  “Something we used on missions to land nearly anywhere in combat zones.  Pilots got shot all the time and we needed to be able to loosely fly them.  V-Plane is limited to much larger zones, so we never used them.”
Railine looked back at the plane, and without movement, the cabin lights were dimming, “Okay, so what are we missing?  How did he get back?  Alone.”
“Our friend may know something he shouldn’t.”
“And we shoot him for that!?”  Ryla shrieked out.
Solide turned, lifting a hand, palm up in a dismissive gesture,.  “No.  W we shoot him because he is the only one left.” 
 
Kalco
Location: Lift Bike, outskirts of Reiko-10 

This was the perfect setting for the hero to make his grand entrance.  Tragically he had been forced to gun down one of his loves, now he would return triumphantly back here to save the other at the moment of impending doom.  Uncanny that he was gearing up to be the sole survivor again; but this time he would bring the hot Laina with him as they escaped this craterous ruined world.  Yes, her soft embrace would be so welcome after the long trip that left all the others dead.
After no response from the base, he was lucky the Lift Bike was left in the hangar.  He could use it to scout the base much easier, and come in from the side, thereby getting a jump on any traitor inside.
Steam rose from the center of Reiko-10;, it must be leaking heat to the cold outside.  Other than the occasional creature he saw out here, the base was not as bad as could be expected with True Forms present.  Someone was likely alive, but why hadn’t they responded to him?
Floating over to the ground vehicle bay, he lifted his pistol and blasted one a creature that was bashing on the door.  I, it dropped silently in the snow storm, only a fraction of its strange broken wing hung hanging above the deep snow.  The hangar door was badly damaged, bashed in but sealed.  He wouldn’t be getting the bike in.  He swung down to Delta Wwing, slid the bike inside, and powered it down.  Stepping off, the small force field that was enveloping him left and the cold of the base hit him, reminding him of the reality on this planet.  The base was way colder than it really should have been though.  
He left a slew of weapons and equipment on the bike and adjusted some of the plating on his armor, tuned the force field bracer he had on, and in general was much better equipped coming back here than he left.  He could not stand one on one against a True Form, but at least give it a good fight.  He would need to join forces with whoever was still alive and take it from there.
He strode forward in his armor, his helmet furled to maximize just how heroic this entrance was going to be;, he couldn’t let that perfect spiky hair be hidden behind a helmet, no way.  He was pretty pissed off Aelishun was lost somewhere in that alien ruin.  The Sledgehammer was cool just on its size, but, he missed that black, elegant shape that stomped everything he came across.
As he walked towards the center, he saw the cause of the cold in the base,: the collapsed central room.  Quite the fight that had occurred here.  He walked in, eyes looking at how different the room was days cycles later.  Where was the trash he was supposed to save anyway?  He walked a bit further in.
“Stop right there,” a deep voice said.
To his right was another voice.,  “Move and I’m blowing your fucking head off,” an the angry voice yelled.
To both sides, men rose out of a clear ambush location: Solide and that fire fighter guy.  Kalco held both hands open in front of him, deciding if he wanted to go for it.  Both of them had some sort of combat plating on, helmets out, and weapons drawn.  A flame thrower for the fire guy, and Solide’s shotgun.  These guys were prepared.  No matter, just a misunderstanding.  A hero’s tale sometimes has comedic elements after all.
“Are you the only one?” Fire guy asked.
“Are you the only two?”
“You shut the fuck up and answer the question,” Solide yelled.
“I’m here too.,”  Tthat little hottie Ryla came out from hiding.  Damn, still looking pretty good, even if she got dressed up in armor.  He hadn’t banged someone in armor in a while.
“I am,.”  Kalco answered.  “Sole Survivor.”  He really liked that title,; he had earned it twice now.  “Naturally.”
“What happened to them?”
“Death Angels,” Kalco lied, using the term they would know.  What he told them wasn’t completely inaccurate, in a way.
“Do we shoot him, or do we test him?”  Flamethrower man asked as an aside.
“I really think it’s best we shoot, no way a Solarian lived.”
“Sole survivor baby,” Kalco said with a cocky tone.
Solide swished his head towards him.,  “You shut the fuck up!”
“But he might be one of us!”  Ryla pleaded.
Kalco felt in the zone.  H, he had solid armor, and a force bracer that could take some hits even without a helmet.  “I don’t really like this welcome you gave me.  Aren’t we on the same side?”
“Keep running your mouth and you are gone, bitch,.”  Kalco didn’t even turn to face himthe angry soldier.
“We should try talking to him, maybe he is sincere…” Ryla begged.
“Where is Laina?” Kalco asked.
“Died.  Death Angel,” Fire guy said.  Laina died to a Death Angel!?
“What!?”  He turned his head to face him.
“Watch it!” Solide warned him.
Through the thin but strong face shield of the armor, the guy’s burn scars were still obvious.  “I am not telling you more, until I’m sure we can trust you.”
“Tell me what happened to her!”  He wanted to fight that larger man so bad right now.  “What the hell happened to Laina!?”
“Careful, he is really considering attacking,” Ryla warned the other two.  Kalco’s aggression dropped from the surprise.  Somehow she knew.  Star Priestess?  Kalco eyed here very closely, and this time not to assess sexual fantasies.  No, she didn’t have the right feel to her.  Perhaps just a prodigy in a Psionic or two.  Perhaps.
The fire guy stated firmly, “Clearly you are well armed, and you will notice we are as well.  It is in our interest to work together, but we are not going to be stupid.  If you have nothing to hide you will listen to us.  I have discovered a test that shows whether you are Solarian or not.”
“And it works!”  Ryla shouted.  “Please, Kalco just do it.”
Kalco did not like where this was going.  The likelihood of just shooting it out and maybe takening Ryla for a bit of fun before finishing her off might be the most prudent option.  
“Don’t fight, please!” s She yelled.  Shit, she definitely had a Psionic or two.  He , had to be careful with his thoughts and emotions.
“What do you want?”  Kalco asked.
“We need a sample of your blood,” the fire guy explained.  “B, by mixing a blood pak in it, we can see if the nanite healing protocols interact.”
Solide added to the other guy, neither lowering their weapon.  “Shit works, Rox wasn’t Solarian.”
“What happened to her?” h He tried to pry for info.
“Heh, don’t think so.  You take his little test and then we talk.”
Kalco tried to clarify, because he thought he was probably in the clear.  “So I give you some of my blood, and if the blood pak reacts to want to heal, I’m safe?”
“Yes.”
Kalco laughed. , “I’m fine with that.” Ryla clapped her hands and looked happy they weren’t going to shoot it out.  “I’ll drop my weapons, but I’m leaving my shield on, I hope you understand.”  He moved slow as he proceeded to unhook  his favorite pistol ‘Aelishun’.  I, in a moment the unfamiliar shape made him realize it was gone in those alien ruins, and instead took off the Sledgehammer model off the retractable micro cords.  He slowly swung his backpack around, and could have made a show of taking the multitude of weapons and grenades out but just put the whole thing down.
Railine’s The firefighter’s words were just as even and cold, but to Kalco’s surprise it wasn’t to him.  “If he was the only one, it means I have an extra vial.  You are getting tested as well.”  
“Wha…what!?”  Ryla looked shocked.  Interesting, she never got tested.  What the hell.
Kalco played it carefully.  ,  “You aren’t fucking testing me until I see that she is safe.  Do you know what Death Angels can do?”
“Quite fucking well,” Solide said, he had his shotgunhis shotgun pointed back at Kalco.
The fire guy had turned and was digging through some supplies.,  “What makes you think not?  I was the only proven Solarian here, until Solide also proved it.  Ryla has never been tested, but is likely safe given the opportunity she had to kill us, but you have disappeared the entire time.”
“Holy fuck, this is how every story ends, with everyone getting killed.”  He thought about diving back at his gun and shooting at him, but talked for now,.  “I am Solarian and you aren’t touching me yet, especially if no one knows if she is safe.”
“I am not testing Ryla until after you.”
“You are testing that bitch.”
“I am testing you first,.” h He said back firmly.
“Fine, but can you aim that fucking gun at her while you are doing this?  I’ve seen this kind of vid before.”  He walked forward, shifting some of the armor plating and exposing his forearm.  “Don’t take too much.  T, this is pure animal, beast blood right here.”
“Shut the fuck up until we know you are safe.”  Solide didn’t aim his gun at Ryla,; this was definitely how everyone gets wiped out.
“Railine, be careful,” Ryla warned.  ‘Railine’, guess that was his name.
He looked at Kalco as he replied to her,.  “I’ am safe because Kalco has to know Solide would shoot both of us if he tries anything.  So in an irony I am actually safer from any hostage attempt he make might think is wise.”
“Never crossed my mind.  I’m a hero.  W, we don’t need hostages, naturally.”
Railine’s large arm and huge hand dwarfed the small scalpel in it.  H, and he held a dish under the arm while he did a quick, skilled slice down a small portion of his the hero’s forearm.
“You start yet, big boy?”  Kalco smirked at him.
Railine squeezed his flesh a bit to get some more blood out.  SHe stepped back, and opened a blood pak, pouring a little in the dish, and pointing to the wound.  He moved forward, dumping the small remnants on Kalco’s wound.
“Wipe it away.”  Kalco did so, and the flesh was smooth.  Railine looked at the dish.,  “Iit’s interacting.”
“So he’s one of us,” Solide said, lowering his shotgun.
“Unless your science is flawed, I sure hope I am.”
“How were you the only one who made it?”  Solide asked.
Kalco then proceeded to relate the story, changing some of the details.  First was about how all four of them went to the first area and found out it was a huge ancient ship that seemed to predate Aelisha, or perhaps was first generation.  “You know upgrades, always makes things worse.”  They had come across a Death Angel at the ship, and Zaier was hit.  They decided to blow it up because it was turning on somehow.  Feyria and Zaier were going to stay and make sure it blew up while him he and Madigan went to the other anomaly.
So far he had kept the story completely accurate.
He continued about the tale about the sensor anomaly being some sort of alien ruins, with unconfirmed figures in the sky and how it instantly took control of his mind.  He explained hHow he barely got out, and it was somehow a long time later and that Madigan was no where to be seen.  How He then told them how he flew back to the alien ship alone.
“You can’t fly, can you?”  Ryla asked.
“No, Feyria had a ’s Grav-Beacon.  It’s how I got back here too.”
“Damn, I forgot that slut had one of those.  It explains a lot why you were the only one on it,” Solide nodded commented, nodding to himself about a mystery that seemed to be concluded.
The questioning derailed his thought process a bit.  He couldn’t admit to killing Feyria, but what story could he make up that she was at least alive enough to program the Grav-Beacon home?  Death Angels, yeah that is always a good fall back.
He continued the story, that he had come back to the ship which was steamy, evidence that  as evidently they had blown it up. , Feyria was there but wounded.  H, he had tried helping her but she set the Grav-Beacon and told him to run.  He did.
“So you left her?”  Solide asked.
“It wasn’t easy.,”  Ssince that line was true, everyone sensed his sincerity and didn’t dig anymore.
He finished by explaining he landed here, scouted because no one was answering, and brought it to a close by meeting them.
“Quite the tale.,”  Solide’s voice had perhaps a touch of sarcasm in it.
Railine looked more friendly.,  “Sorry about that.  We just had to make sure,.  Rox and Laina weren’t one of us.  Glad there are four.  Okay Ryla, I know you hate blood but…”
The L word made him pause,.  “What?  What did you say about Laina?”
“Waseren’t Solarian,” Solide had added for Railine.
“What the fuck do you mean?”  Hhe could feel his anger rising.
Railine explained, “This may be tough for you, but try to listen.  Rox was killed, there was an argument about what to do, and Aria shot, and we thought killed, Laina”
Kalco was gripping his fist,.  “Thought?  Where the fuck is Aria?”
“All of them died.,”  Railine pointed towards the collapsed ceiling.  “I was doing the test and Aria had checked Laina when she exploded out and killed Aria and was some sort of Death Angel herself.  The three of us took her down, but the room collapsed and buried all three of the women.”
“He is getting really hostile,” Ryla said.
“How fucking stupid are you!?  I knew Laina forever, she was not a Death Angel!  You murdered Laina!”  He suddenly realized he had been trapped.  The whole test was useless.  H, he didn’t know if it worked, or if any of these guys were clean.  Laina was probably the last Solarian here and they killed her.  Fuck, he didn’t have much time.
Solide was yelling something, but he calmly walked back to where his stuff was, bent down, and in one smooth motion lifted his pistol at Ryla and pulled the trigger.  She shifted her head substantially to dodge the clean shot he had on her.  How the fuck did she know it was coming?!.  
No matter.  H, he rapidly shifted tohe center of mass and pumped four sledge rounds into her.  S, she had tried dodging far more than he thought she was capable of but the third of the four pack caught her in the side.  With a satisfying ‘dDong’ sound it dumped all of its momentum straight into her as she tilted and tripped.  Another two in her falling body probably was enough to end her.
“Fucker!”  Solide yelled, as a bright light shone shiningup around Kalco as the rounds of Solide’s shotgun hit over and over.  The flashes were insanely bright,; his weapon was far more powerful than Kalco expected.  He aimed at Solide and pulled the trigger, but he had ducked to the side.  He was damn good, he’d hand him that.  He swung towards Railine at the same time a wave of fire was belching out at Kalco.
The shield protected him, as it burned on the outside but the temperature was rapidly rising.  He shot a few times in the direction, likely hitting him but did not know for sure.  His backpack was within the protective field of his shield and he ripped through it, finding some grenades.  He could not see with the flames all around him but primed his own grenades, listening to the rapid fire of Solide’s shotgun over and over on his shield.  The shield was weakening fast;, it was not a super high end one at all.  He tossed them grenades towards Solide and dashed back towards Delta wWing, the protective bubble of his shield defending him against the flames all around him.
Without warning, as is often the case, his shield failed as a shotgun round hit him hard in the leg, blowing a sizeable amount of flesh off between gaps in the armor.  He collapsed through the Delta door and rolled clear.  Expertly he grabbed the ReNew Pak  Feyria had given him, stabbing it in his leg.  In moments the emergency nanites and dense nutrients to support their mission ripped through his body, targeting in this case the leg hit by the super powerful shotgun.  They immediately stretched microscopic cords across the gulf in his leg, reeling the flesh together and creating a framework of synthetic flesh along with bone that for all intent functioned like the real quarter of his leg that had been blown away.  The multitude of nanites included ones to reconnect nerve tissues so that his leg could be controlled in all ways normally.
The spray of blood on the floor had to be an indication to Solide he had hit Kalco and knew he would be wounded.  Kalco got up and backed away, crouching and readying to kill that fucker when he came in.
A grenade rolled in, where he would have been and exploded.  Kalco covered his face and ducked slightly for from the blast.  What was not expected was theat Solide would charge through nearly immediately after it exploded.  He, found Kalco and tackled him to the ground, holding a combat knife in both his hands as he was forcing it down on the pinned man.

“We are Solarian, what the fuck did you do!?”  Solide asked, shoving the knife closer and closer to Kalco’s throat.  Blood was leaking on the glass of his helmet, pooling on the inside.  He had been hit hard by Kalco’s grenades.
“You killed Laina!”  He lifted his left hand, pulling the trigger at Solide.  It caught him in the shoulder, knocking him off balance.  He Solide slashed widely with the knife and it caught Kalco’s left forearm.  I as it slid down and through the born , neatly slicing his arm nearly in half before it was pulled out by distance near the palm.
Solide dove back at him,.  “She was a Death Angel you stupid fuck!”  At this point the knife was hitting his armor, and on some level the molecular structure was doing their its best to resist the mono-edge of the knife.  “Out of your fucking grenades!?  You don’t stand a chance of killing me without one, you little bitch.”
Kalco managed a smirk, as the knife was piercing him as he nodded , nodding to his right,. “Naturally.”  He had one last grenade in his right hand ands he pressed the detonator asnd both of them were swallowed out of existence .

 
Rox
Location: Ancient Ship

Zaier was looking over the controls of the ancient Angelian ship that the Aelisha had found.  Ironic, many of the original Aelisha ships were not Aelisha at all, and even now these old ones were superior than almost all Aelisha ships.  Not that he knew that was the race’s name who had made these ships so long ago.  On a higher level, he knew of them and their meddling but not in the conventional sense.  He was glad his Axl resonated this way;, seeing things from this point of view he highly doubted he would be on such a sentimental and foolish side.
Perhaps they knew his inclinations and that is why he ended up here.
“Just because everyone else forgot about you, doesn’t mean I did.  You have been such a bad boy here all alone.”
He snapped his head to the left, then to the right where a strong, playful woman sat leaning against the door.  Her arms were crossed and her hair had colored beads on a few sections.  Zaier said nothing, running to the next room to grab the pulse rifle before he , came back and precisely delivered bursts of ammo into her head.  Some flashes of blue came out the back side, but her face remained pristine immaculate.
“Base dimensional weapons like that do very little, I hope you understand.”  She laughed a few times.  He held the trigger down for full auto and after dumping the entire clip into her, concluded she was correct.  “Without an Axl weapon it is nearly impossible to harm us, much to a similar but lesser extent as yourself now.”
He put the weapon down,.  “Why are you here?”
“I wanted someone to talk to, I was lonely.  You are still alive this time because your love didn’t gun you down for being a fake.  She knew something was wrong.  C, cute, but tragic it happened that way.”
Turning He turned back towards the console, doing his best to ignore the change in her appearance; there was nothing he could do, after all. the development of her appearance was interesting but there was nothing he could do.  That element of powerlessness bothered him, but his mental control was immaculate.  “Are you going to fight me?”
“I’d win.”
He turned to her, seeing such a simple Solarian body that be lied to the reality of what she really was.  He understood that on a level not many did.  “I know.”
“You are smarter than you let on, not that you hide you intellect.  But even your real form would not last.”
“I know,.”  Zaier repeated himself.  Of course he wasn’t talking about just a simple Solarian body.
“I am not going to fight you.  This Fate Line is not going anywhere, so figured I might as well enjoy your company in this form for a bit.”
He hated how casual her types were.  After he truly awoke, that knowledge of their general stereotype had filled him and he didn’t like it.
“This doesn’t conclude with my success?”
She shook her head no.
“So you kill me?”  He faced her wondering what she was now waiting for.
“I can’t interfere like that, you know.”  She got a sly look on her face,.  “Well, given that this Line ends, I could interfere, but I suppose it’s out of habit I don’t.”
Zaier only looked at her. , “I don’t get those rules at all.  How come I am not bound by them?”
“Not the same as me.  You’re a lower level;, there is a large gulf between us.”
“Just confirm for me, you are indeed a LineGod ?”
She nodded rapidly. , “Damn cute for one too, huh?”
He did not agree exactly. , “I’ve always found cerebral pursuits far more stimulating than such base desires.”
“Ironic, from for my level base desires are oddly valuable.”
“If you willPlease excuse my ignorance, as I understand the generality from an instinctual, visceral level.  I cannot grasp why I cannot kill you, and you indeed have a power beyond mine, but in so many simple ways you’re…” he did not pause to think of the right word, so much as to look at her while he said it, “worthless.”
She feigned pain,.  “Ahh, you stab me so deep with your words.,”  Sshe took her hand stabbing and stabbed it towards her heart as a display of blood exploded out behind her as real as if she had been stabbed by something explosive.
Zaier bit his lower lip. , “Your type is disturbing.”
Rox lifted her face and had a huge smile on it, before laughing to herself.  “Our humor may be vastly different, but you do realize your reaction is part of the fun.”
His lungs swelled from the atmosphere as he let it out slow to maintain control.  “I see nothing humorous about this situation.”
She held her arms wide at her side,.  “You’re viewing this far too narrowly.  You start zooming out,” she moved her head backwards while bringing her hands together, “you see how silly and small this interaction is.  You’d get as big of a kick out of this joyous opportunity as I am.  It’s like using binoculars in reverse!”
“Can you demonstrate your ignorance any more thoroughly?”
“In reverse?”  She looked sad and pleading.
“So I can seriously not kill you?”
“If you had a CAO you probably could.”
Zaier looked away from her. , “Reiko has a lot of them.  T, that’s why this is all occurring.”
“An acting agent like yourself, even if based on MalAxls, is still comparable to the Axl equivalent.  You get your modified True Form powers, and they often get CAO harmonics.  Seems pretty fair.  I hate that you have to fight.  You should see us and hyper True Forms, those battle are vicious.”
“You mean between a LineGod and what is the name, a Mal-LineGod?  I hate your term ‘mal’, I think you are the disease here.”
“Do you know we are using the Aelisha terms for these?  Another big player calls them ‘MACs’ – Malignant Axl Creature, perhaps a colder but more accurate name.”
Zaier shook his head. , “I don’t care what the name is.”
She lifted her index finger to her nose as she looked puzzled,.  “You call yourself intellectual, so here is a little of perhaps a thought experiment for you.”
He waited in silence.
“Well?” s She asked.
“Get on with it.”
“No fun!”  She looked sad.  “Say there is a big tournament, thousands of fans are all around watching.  They are waving their banners…,”  sShe lifted her two hands in a fist, swinging back and forth as if she was waving a flag.  “Team…hmm what should we call them, Zaier?  We need something cute for them.”
“Idiot.”
She nodded. , “Team Idio.  T they are kind of the underdog, a bit of a fan favorite because they are plucky and will get it done against some big odds.  They are taking on the reigning champs…uh, what should their name be?”
In his mind he probably would be swearing but calmly stated, “Idiot.”
“Team I-ot.  E, ewww they are like the guys you kind of love to hate.  They just always win, no mercy.  People like them because they always win, perfect score, hot guys, all that.  It’s like the pretty girls and the jock guys hanging together beating down the poor nerds in academy.  D, didn’t you always hate that power imbalance?”
“The weak deserved their beatings.  Evolution.  Natural.”
Rox shook her head. , “Well, I see you are an I-ot fan.  O, of course they got tons of fans, they just keep winning, after all.”
He was gritting his teeth together;, this girl had a remarkably ability to annoy him.  He had such grand plans to leave this planet in this ancient racial ship to accomplish the goals he was awoken into and she was talking about some stupid story she was making up.  Claiming, with perfect validity she would probably know, that this Fate Line ended ‘some-when’ soon.
“Why just fake a flag?”  he asked her.
She smiled, started waving her fake flag again, and in one instant it was suddenly a real flag, it was a light blue with a gold symbol in the middle. “Go Idio!  You can do it!”  Then she jumped and faced the spot she just was, the flag was now black with a red motif.   now “Shut up!  I-ots are going to crush one evey last bug!”  She jumped back to her first place, “I-di-o!  I-di-o!  GOOO!”  She went back to her second place, “I-ot!  I-ot!” 
She then jumped to the middle, the flag no longer existed present and as she faced Zaier.  H, her reckless energy was now replaced by a seriousness as she spoke slowly and carefully.,  “Here is where it gets fun.”  He started paying a bit more attention to her vastly stupid metaphor.  “Allow me to phrase this succinctly for you.”
The entire scene playing itself out on the ship that was rumbling and melting it self out of the ice was so different from the macabre scene left on Reiko-10 where everyone had died and the last vestiges of the base were burning down.
Rox’s voice was low compared to the high-pitched cheerleading she had just done.  “You are a player on one of these teams: is it your presence on the team that matters, or where your heart is?  If you are an I-ot in your heart, those evil guys, but I kidnap you and you mistakenly play for Idio -–  after all this could be some gravball game or something, you know how crazy those get -– you play on Idio and they win.  Do you win?”
It was a bit of an interest to him that she was actually approaching this from a cerebral aspect like he had indicted he liked earlier.  Her metaphor seemed simplistic but knew with what he was dealing with there was a disturbing method to her madness.
“Did I know I was on I-ot?”  He hated to use her stupid term.
“Sure, I take the bag off your head and with horror you realize your heart was with the team you just beat.  But remember, everyone on this team thinks you are a player.  L, look, you are even on the roster!”  She put her left arm behind her back and pulled out a physical data sheet, presenting it to Zaier
TEAM IDIO
Captain: Zaier
It proceeded to list a bunch of names that were meaningless.
“Then I lost,” he said strongly.
“Simply because of your knowledge?”  She tossed the data sheet behind her and, it disappeared in a sparkle that was interesting to watch.
“Quite simply.”
“Okayokayokay,” she swung her hands back and forth, “now same scenario.  N, need to see all the cheering fans again?”
“No.”
“My cute flag?” s She asked, looking like a sad puppy.
“No.”
“Fine.  You were born of I-ot blood, but as a little baby during a crisis an Idio picks you up, those nice guys.  You grow up all your life thinking Idio is your family.  You help them win, you ‘know’ it is your family.  Do you win?”
“No.  I am of I-ot blood.  I betrayed them.”
“You don’t know.”
“Ignorance is no excuse,” he said to her.
She shook her finger at him like a teacher.  “Not logical in the slightest.  You have no way of knowing.”
“It doesn’t matter if I know, from the universal perspective, it was clear I was a traitor.”
Rox turned away from him.  She saw the argument he was taking, and it made sense.  Sad he believed that, in some ways it was true.
“Is this some stupid, veiled reference to myself?”
“Hmm, that’d be a good story, wouldn’t it!”
“Why don’t I ask you some things,” he said.
“Oh, I like my men forceful.”
“Are you going to answer?”
“Probably~”
“From my perspective there seems to be two somewhat concurrent paths here: we have these mutated figures occurring here which are not complete adaptations to your mislabeled ‘Mal-Axls’, which in a lot of ways can be compared to standard life forms only built of the negative animating element.”
He continued, “Then there are those much rarer that perhaps could be called ‘compatible’ which resonate and, I confess my ignorance here, harmonize to a deeper level like myself.”
Rox nodded.,  “So far so good.  D, do you know that, or did you learn it?”
He turned from her.,  “I feel it.  But here is my question, why can I do this?”  He hovered off the ground, and things that looked vaguely like Daijin Star harmonic plates mixed with some type of demon wings appeared behind his back.  B and by raising his hand he shot energy that crystallized into solid projectiles that blew apart a wall.  He went back to ‘normal’ form and turned and looked at her.
She shrugged. , “Because you are one of the rare ones that is compatible with MalAxls to a high degree that it becomes a ‘True Form’ of you and them together.”
“I get that, but I a missing something here.,”  Hhe lifted both hands. , “Oon the bottom here you have regular life forms, and on this side you have these mal-adaptations…I hate using your word by the way.”  He moved his hands up. , “On the next stage you apparently have beings like me on this side, but I am not sure what’s on ‘your’ side.”  He lifted his hands again. , “Aand at the highest level, you have LineGods on your side, and who knows on my side.”
Rox nodded approvingly. , “You are pretty smart.  Line Knights  and Hyper True Forms, that’s your answer.”
“What?”
She smiled,.  “All in time.  I won’t by as coy as I would like to be, and will actually answer something implictimplicit here.  Your power comes from the MalAxls being much more dense and attractive to its own element, thus your power is of a more reactive but manifesting type.  Whereas Axls are more prevalent but diffuse, and it is more manifesting but reactive.”
“Your semantics are purposely obfuscating, are they not?”
She smiled and giggled.
Zaier looked away. , “Quite frankly, whatever my Axl equivalent is does not seem powerful at all.”
Rox agreed. , “Without concentrated Axls they do not stand a chance.”
“Yet,” he looked at Rox, this dumb little girl giggling, laughing and joking who that was a dimensional god beyond his already higher level, “yYou are concentrated.  I can feel that.  If we fought, you cold could destroy me.”
“The gulf between us is vast.  But,” she lifted both her hands in an exaggerated shrug, “your level is the last that can change the Lines.  I can’t.  I can see them, but can’t touch, so to say.”
“You mentioned that.  S, so you couldn’t kill me after all?”
Her smiled turned dark,.  “Oh I could right now.”  She snapped her hand down to the side and it changed into a huge blade
Zaier took a step back, worry on his face.
She laughed boisterously, holding her hand that was back to normal to her face.  “Kidding.  Well, kinda.  Yeah, I could wreck you if I wanted!  But only in specific circumstances, namely what is about to happen here.”  She made a scene out of drawing a square in the air and when she completed it, it was showing a structure steaming in the snow.
“The Reiko-10 reactor?  What’s that stupid thing have to do with anything?”
“A lot, unfortunately.  The way things are going to play out, I doubt I will talk to you again in this way.  If and when we talk again, it will just be as Zaier a Solarian and Rox a Solarian.”
“What do you even mean?”
“The tragic thing for you is, if Idio wins, you will never realize that your heart would have been with I-ot.  You will be carried to victory unknowingly.”
“I already told you about my loyalties and that the universe would know I am a traitor.  So if that is true, that is unfortunate.”
She came over and gave him a hug as he pushed her off. , “In the end, reality is a pretty forgiving place at the limits of what you may understand.”
He looked back at her screen.  T, the reactor did not look good, the structure was shaking violently.  “Wait, is that melting down?”
It took longer than a moment, but not much more than that for the Fusion Reactor to finally trigger a runaway reaction that blew a quarter of the planet apart.  From space the large light might have looked pretty along with the debris pattern of the former-planet now in space as the sphere was now gouged out in a huge way.  The explosion annihilated everything within the blast, and a shockwave likely killed nearly anything else of the planet.  The mixture of the huge force, the loss of mass, the lopsided planet all added together to throw the orbit way out of whack.  The frozen world of Reiko enjoyed a very brief moment at a normal temperature before becoming too hot and falling into the Reiko star.

Railine
Location: Reiko-10, Bunkered room

Railine was confident he had unlocked a Chrono Psionic as there were various coalescing visions in his mind about what was going to happen.  He looked at Rox and she turned back to wink and smile at him.  It must have been her flirting with him.  He was logical and simply ignored the fallacies of why had she turned around with no impetus, and his own disbelief at that it was a flirt because he could not explain it any other way.  No way she could know he knew right?  Psionics didn’t work that way.  They were not some sort of group consensus or ability.
There was a girl he knew when they were younger that had saved him through a Psionic ability she had.  He really should have asked her more about it, but it was clear it was not ‘always on’ and seemed to be triggered only right before something occurred.  For that reason that is why he thought it was a Psionic he had suddenly awoken in his mind.
Stories of people in bad situations that ‘awoke’ abilities they had in them was justified and proven correct.  Many of these people swore they had apparently no Psionic ability in whatever branch they now came to possess as it kicked in and saved them right before it occurred.  
Clearly this did not happen with everyone as the universe was a hostile place where people were maimed and killed horribly every moment.  Yet he was one of the lucky few it was happening to.  He would save Rox like his friend had saved him as a youth.
He took a step forward to warn her after these visions came to him 
*BOOM*
The shock hit everyone around them twice, one was the physical shockwave of the weapon, the second was the emotional shock of being turned o n.  It took moments for the physical reactions as it likewise took moments for Rox’s body to react, as it was still standing with the right side of her face missing.  Solide wasted zero time pumping another shell through her body, exploding flesh into the back wall that sent her body down.
“No…way…”  Railine stood stunned, the axe he brought back from Reiko-7 had warmed up as the blood was slowly dripping onto the floor.  The V-Plane was out of Comm distance due to the planet’s energy fields, and this murder seemed perfectly timed for this exact opening.  The other crew was now gone when Solide had made his move.
He had seen this before;, it was all nearly the same except his very slight different reaction of trying to warn her.
He looked down at his hand, seeing it was covered in red blood in one long streak.  ‘That one streak of blood was once in Rox,’ he thought in an odd fashion.
The scene played out almost loosely the loose same way he remembered it occurring.  There would be times he felt like he should have said something, and some recited lines would be lost and it would pick back up when someone else did something that did not involve him.
He stared at the blood of Rox on his hand.  It was like a single long ‘1’ down the back and a tip of his finger.
‘This wasn’t like the vision…’ He looked up in a new panic that whatever he thought he saw was off-enough to not be relied upon while other’s acted appropriately .  Solide and Laina argued.  Solide left.  Laina pronounced Rox dead.  Ryla cried more.  Aria stood silently.
He was not sure he liked having a Psionic.  T, the line was very blurred between what was reality, and what was some sort of Chrono vision of the future.  He could hardly react with how bad this was messing with him.  Perhaps he needed time to hone it, but with Rox dead and things spiraling out of control he was not sure he could learn fast enough.
It was as if time was moving slow, as he looked back down at his hand.  S, something important was happening here.  Something very critical was on the verge of his understanding.  Something to do with this blood.
Yes, something with her blood was important.
Someone had come up to him,.  “Are you ok?”  He pushed them away, afraid they would distract him from this important discovery.  They walked away.  Time continued in the distorted fashion as he stared at the blood.
There was growling as the dogs saw something, and a moment later he was hit hard from behind.  He crashed down hard, and had only enough time to turn around to see the creature with a sad face sad like Aria but looked more like Feyria this time. He had little time to ponder this before it slashed again at him and with tremendous power ripped him apart.  The last thing he heard was Ryla screaming and was shocked at how bad the planet’s atmosphere felt on his rended back .

Railine
Location: Reiko-10, Bunkered room

Railine had déjà vu a lot as a kid, which was interesting to think about.  Why would he have it when as a kid he had seen so much less than as an adult?  There was nothing to feel familiar about when he only knew the small neighborhood he had grown up in the deep forests of Lania Prime.
Older, he hardly ever had it anymore.  M, maybe it was just a bad way the brain was wired; perhaps that as a kid seeing things reminded him of some similarity to the small world-view constructed in the brain.  Maybe it was something with development where connections had to be made, no matter how specious they might be.  Once older, seeing so many things like he had, sometimes there were things that just were unlike other experiences he had.
The curiosity of course, was why something he forgeot he ever had was now hitting him so hard.  He was trapped on a small military base where most of the people were missing, and a fraction of the survivors had just left.  There was nothing like this he had experienced before but it was hitting him so hard.
The small group was in the barricaded room when the strong feeling hit Railine.  He had seen this before on some level.  Something with Rox.  He turned to face the womaen who mysteriously turned around, winked at him, and smiled.
He knew what was going to happen here,.  Rox was going to get blindsided by Solide.  She would drop to the floor dead, and there would be discussion if she actually was dead.  Something about her blood.  Something about his arm.  He looked down but saw the burn scarred hand he had his whole lifke looking back at him.
*BOOM*
The shock hit everyone around them twice, one was the physical shockwave of the weapon, the second was the emotional shock of being turned on.  It took moments for the physical reactions as it likewise took moments for Rox’s body to react, as it was still standing with the right side of her face missing.  Solide wasted zero time pumping another shell through her body, exploding flesh into the back wall that sent her body down.
Railine was not as shocked as he once was.  On some level he expected this.  He was close enough that he felt a spray of blood on him.  Before he looked down he knew what he would see.  It would be a giant tally mark of sorts on his hand from Rox.
“One…” he said to himself in a daze as those around him yelled, swore, cried, and fought.  In his own world something serious was happening and as aware of his surroundings as he always was, it was lacking right now.
A glance down confirmed what he ‘knew’.  He remembered its similarity to a ‘1’ and that’s why it stuck out in the vision.  He was not sure what was happening as it played out loosely as it had in the past.  There were times he would have said something that the silence caused subtle changes but it generally occurred the same.
When a flash of inspiration hit his logical mind, he and took a splash of the blood from Rox’s tally on his hand and drew a second mark right off of it.  
“Two,” he said to himself as a reminder, “Bbecause Solide fires two shots.  He always fires two.”  He held his hand up, watching with divine inspiration at the simple counting exercise.
“Wrong fucker, I got one more for you, you alien freak .”  Railine was surprised by the intense inward crushing of pain he felt.  It only lasted a moment until he was gratefully dead.  The last thing he heard was Ryla screaming.

Railine
Location: Reiko-10, Bunkered room

Railine had felt really dumb for most of the day walking around with a ‘2’ written in marker on his hand.  He was glad to keep his gloves on and when certain things started falling into place he watched with a wariness mixed with excitement.
The small group was in the barricaded room when a strong feeling hit Railine.  He had seen this before on some level.  Something with Rox.  Looking down at his hand – which was now gloveless since he removed them to move tables for the barricade – that his gloves were currently off from moving tables he saw the ‘2’ and thought back to Rox.  Facing He faced the womaen, who mysteriously turned around and mouthed the words ‘good job’, which seemed different than he remembered.  He was really confused by how she knew and what she meant,; and wondered if he was losing it as his vision was not right when it all clicked back into place.
*BOOM*
There were two rapid fire shots like usual and everyone except Railine was shocked what had happened.  The violence was distant, just like watching a movie he had seen a hundred times of some random character dying.
Those around him were mired in confusion.  H, he was as well but more about the implications of seeing this before.  He remembered a ‘1’ of blood, that was for sure.  There was also a two ‘2’ of blood he added once, then this own two ‘2’ in marker.  
“Ugh…”  Hhe knelt to the ground while everyone else was screaming and arguing.  His own head was swimming.  What was happening?  He remembered those numbers in the past, but what exactly was the point?  This vision was useless as he could not react in time to save Rox.  If this was Chrono Psionics, they were worthless, and they severely slowed down his mental process with all this confusion about what he had really seen.
All the thoughts in his mind were making him nauseous.  Why had he been so lax in his studies of what Psionics were like for those that had them?  Especially considering his he had a young girl female friend that saved his life.  The ignorance on that subject was slamming him with cruel, unrelenting punishment.  If he only knew this was typical maybe he could have reacted better.
Solide yelled at Laina, “I hate your fucking face, but I respect you can at least still stand.  L, look at what a stupid fuck this guy is, I at least expected better out of you!”  It was directed to Railine but he cared little about useless words.
Railine looked at Rox’s head cocked back and her brain leaking out and he started throwing up due to the friendship he had with the woman.  The stinging burned his throat and nose, making his eyes water even more.  Her beads she had in her hair that she had consciously chose to put in recently at some point where she was still alive was what had pushed him over the edge.
His eyes teared up and he coughed as he watched the scene in front of him play nearly the same without his occasional lines uttered or small changes like Solide’s comment about Railine’s kneeling or /vomiting.  That is when he knew what had to be done.  
Rox was potentially beyond saving, and all of this was a gap to give Railine the chance to strike.  Solide had been facing Laina and Aria who were both standing off against him.  He had these Psionic visions to stop this mad man .
Railine had never attacked a Solarian with hostility but in that moment he knew many things beyond his control were counting on him for it to occur.  He slowly reached back to his axe on his back, and in once fast move dashed upwards at Solide.  
The guard was good and had sensed the attack and was in the process of dodging but Railine’s surprise and speed took the dayhad the advantage.  T and the edge caught most of Solide’s side as it tore through effortlessly.  
Solide slipped to the floor, and in a panic he reached for the guts spilling out of his body.  “Fuck, fuck!  YOU STUPID FUCK…GAH!  I CAN’T DIE HERE!”
Solide stopped the desperate attempt to save himself and lifted his gun at Railine.  The large man kicked the gun out of his hands.  Solide looked panicked.,  “Laina save me!  Bitch, do something!”
Railine looked coldly at her,.  “Don’t.”
Laina forced herself to look away as Ryla’s cries pounded the room.
“Fu…ck…”
Railine brought the fire axe down on Solide and ended his suffering and his murder spree.
Aria walked up to him.  , “I did not think you had it in you.  You’d have made a good soldier.”
Railine was feeling a coldness to his personality.  “And then there were four,” he said without any emotion as new red blood dripped off the molecular edge of the axe.
Four.
…Four.
He was so content with the kill on Solide, the fact he had bested the man, that he forgot the other warning part of the vision when the Feyria-like creature dashed in.  It was slightly different this time, but it knocked Aria to the floor and when it hit him, cleaving off his right leg before it cutcutting him in half, the contentment didn’t last long.

Solide
Location: Reiko-10, Bunkered Room

*Boom!*
The loud retort of the shotgun caused a few people to jump delayed moments later, much later than the disconnected part of her face that was blown into the back wall.  Her body stood awkwardly for a moment when Solide pumped around round into her chest, that blew blood and flesh out the backside as the body went down fast.  He loved Claim Jumper;, it felt so satisfying destroying that bitch.
“Holy…shit…”  Railine gripped the bloody axe as his shocked face looked stared at the sudden betrayal and its deadly consequence.
“Rox….nooooooo!”  Ryla screamed loudly, dropping to her knees.
“Solide, what the fuck are you doing!?”  Kalco  had his pistol leveled right at him.  Zaier had expertly knelt, bringing his rifle up to his shoulder, his face down the holographic targeting system that was sighted directly on Solide’s heart.
Laina looked at the standoff of the two on one men and decided her past was too powerful to not listen to as she broke from behind Kalco to dash over to where Rox’s body was bleeding out.
Solide swung his high tech shotgun ‘Claim Jumper’ one handed at her face. , “You touch her and I’ll blow your fucking head off, bitch.”
“Rox….whyyyy!?”  Ryla was crying loud to the tense silence the rest of the room had.
“She…was one of us!”  Laina’s voice pleaded.
Zaier’s voice was firm, powerful yet calm, “You will not kill both of us before we put a bullet through you, and Laina will not save you.”
“Like I want that bitch touching me!”  Solide interrupted.
“Explain yourself, you are smarter than this,” Zaier requested.  It should be noted he never once took his finger off the trigger nor wavered from the heart kill shot.
Solide looked hard at Ryla. , “Come with me if you want to live.”
“Don’t go with that maniac,.”  Zaier ordered her.
With two trained soldier’s weapons on him, he looked only at the young girl he had an affinity for. , “You are a big girl, Ryla.  T, this isn’t about right or wrong.  T, there’s no guarantee anyone makes it out of this alive.”  She looked down, confused as to whom to follow.
“Throw your weapon down.  We can talk this through.”
“What, so you can lock me up, boy?  I’m one of the few fucking Solarians here, what don’t you get about that!?  Half you fucks are probably infected or sleeper agents; this reeks of alien intervention.  It’s quite clear to me why I ended up on this base with old Kalco.”
Kalco’s face flinched for a moment over the implication that he had no idea what it meant .
He looked over his shoulder,.  “What, you going to shoot a Solarian?  There’s not many of us left.  That’s assuming you’re even one, Zaier!  HAHAHAH!!!”  He laughed maniacally as he walked away into the darkness down the wing.  Somewhere from the dark he called out, “You hesitated.  A, an agent or alien would have taken the shot for sure!”
“Rox!”  Laina dashed forward, plunging her hand onto the bloody mess of Rox’s left face.  Even to those not medically trained it did not look good.  The surprise critical hit from point blank was impossible to evade, and the mysterious power of his weapon was unfortunate for her life.
Railine and Aria both went forward, Railine dropping his big axe and Aria slinging her rifle over her back.  They were both skilled medical providers themselves, but inferior to Laina.  Railine was pushing some of her spilled entrails into her stomach cavity and holding it there, hoping beyond hope the nanites might be able to save her as he took out Uundifferentiated Ttissue.  He slathered , slathering the white goo on his hand and jammeding it in her wound, trying to get it onto the organs where the nanites would sync and attempt to reconstruct what was left of the kidney he was touching.
Despite the dying or dead woman on the floor the suspicion was intensifying among those not involved with trying to save Rox.  “What did he mean about you?”  Zaier asked Kalco.
“I have no idea.  He felt familiar in some way, but I’ve never seen him before this assignment.”
“Now is not the time for secrets, and for all intents I suspect I have a higher clearance than you,” Zaier threw down.
“Ha, well that merely confirms a suspicion I had about you, and this whole damn place.  As for clearances, I actually doubt it, but it doesn’t matter; that shit doesn’t matter at all anymore.  But no, I don’t know him.”
“Are you telling me the truth?”  Zaier asked in a tone that said the answer was no.
“What the fuck are you saying?”  Kalco squared up to him.  Physically Kalco was superior to Zaier, that was undeniable, but Zaier showed absolutely no hesitation or waver.
“Stop fighting you two!”  Ryla yelled. , “Tthis is what they want for us!”
“They?”  Kalco asked.
Ryla sobbed again.,  “These monsters…  gGod why is this happening…”
The two men faced each other uneasily while the three medical people worked on Rox’s shot body.
“What do you know, Kalco?”  Zaier asked firmly.
“What the fuck do you know, ‘Zaier’!?” h He shot back.
At the same moment both of them drew their weapons again, only at each other.
“I am not joking.”
“Neither am I,” Kalco responded.
“Stop it!”  Ryla pushed herself off the floor and stood in between the two men’s firing line, holding her hands out to the side in a protest.  Her body would do little to stop Kalco’s Aelisha technology pistol, ‘Aelishun’, aperhaps back handed reference he thought no one would get with its name ‘Aelishun’.  Nor would her body even stop the much weaker but still very competent Pulse Rifle in the base commander’s hands.
Solide turned and began walking away.  H, he was about to reach the door when something warm was leaking down his leg.  He looked down and saw something silver sticking through his stomach.  He touched it, and his hand came back red from below.  He jerked his head to the side. , Laina was standing there with a focused look on her face, her Nano-Blade stabbed through Solide.
“I had…a bad feeling…about you.”
“Guess you were right,” she replied darkly.  sShe slashed through him, and swung a second time, cleaving his body and killing him.

Railine
Location: Reiko-10, Bunkered room

He was sure he had been on ‘2’ for a while. What he remembered was that there was an association with the number.,  ‘1’ was the splash of blood from Rox that aeffected him deeply.  ‘2’ was his association with that Solide always fired twice.  But there was nothing important about the number 3 to him.
Wait.  A at least once was when he attacked and killed Solide from the surprise attack.  Did that just happen?  He shook his head.  T, these thoughts were far too dangerous to let infect him.  No, he remembered the number ‘4’ because that’s how many were left after Rox and Solide were both killed in such a short period of time.
Confident ‘3’ had been experienced multiple times at the minimum, he marked his hand with a ‘4’.  “Four  is how many are left after Solide kills Rox and leaves.  Four is how many is left after I killed Solide.”
Some might have thought they were going insane perhaps, but to Railine he felt like the divine was speaking to him.  Providence wanted Solide murdered .
Madigan would never understand such things like this.  But to Railine, visions, dreams, Ghosts, anything or everything of that nature seemed plausible to him.  Having some sort of near psychotic break as a way to show him Solide needed to be killed didn’t seem that outlandish.
The events led predictably towards the moment he had been shown.  Earlier when they were converting the room into a makeshift bunker he had innocuously laid his axe against a conglomeration of furniture.  With all the equipment being shuffled around everywhere, ahis weapon did not stick out as others had their weapons laid on tables as well.
No one knew the position was right behind where Solide would make his kill on Rox in some sort of Chrono Line he had witnessed.  
His new power of seeing the Chrono Lines before they occurred would make him a very powerful assassin.  He could see it already, the new mission the divine had given him, the evil he would smite out of here.  First would be ending this murderer before he could do his evil.
Onwards time flowed, and Zaier made his pitch about why they should split up.  Railine never thought it was a good move, but his vision had nothing to do with it, and did not fight it.  He slowly made his way out of the room, pulling up a virtual sensor tracking the V-Plane.  There was a certain distance away from the base that the natural distortions of the planet rendered communication too bad to use.  Solide knew and that is when he struck.  
With an uncanny awareness of watching a movie he had seen before but now from a new angle he watched Solide move into position.  He wWatched Rox partly move away from the group.  Watched others go through their meaningless motions.  How pedestrian they seemed.  H, he was like that until just this day of awaking his Psionics.  He went back to watching Solide getting closer to where Railine would make his move.  He glanced at Rox again.  H, he knew she would look behind her for some reason and smile at him and very shortly after get killed.  Very soon that…
Rox looked down the random hallway Railine was hiding in and smiled.  She smiled at him.
Railine faltered for a moment, but much like the ancient Samurai he already had the action in his mind;, he would complete that slash even if his head was cut off.  In this case his target did not know it was coming.  Solide was in the process of lifting the shotgun at Rox when Railine’s axe connected.
The edge was not a vibro –, ‘merely’ a molecular edge instead – but without advanced armor or shields it was still like tearing through paper.  Solide was sent to the ground dead and dismembered in a single diagonal strike.
“I did it…”  Hhe breathed hard, and felt some sort of relief that the strange vision of this occurring so many times was evidently the way Chrono Psionics manifested and were experienced.  In it, he gained a new respect for those who had the Chrono Psionics, as they were quiet a weird thing on the mind.
He had saved Rox.
“Ahhh!”  Ryla dropped to her knees in almost the same way, crying and crying.  Aria looked at him in a confused way, muted to her levels of near expressionless-ness.  His feeling of victory felt short lived;, why were the girls he was with so upset he had just saved them?  Of course, it’s because they didn’t have the power he did.
“Good try, but this path doesn’t end right.”  The words were very strange.  He turned to look at Rox who had whispered it to him.  The girl who had been shot dead in vision after vision was whispering to him in a way she should not know nothing about.
“What?”  he asked.
She shrugged, and pointed to his left.  H, he turned in time to see that Laina silently had closed the distance and was slashing at him.  Much like how his edge had ended Solide, her Nano-Blade bit into him with such incredible, over-whelming pain that the only thing he could feel was the warmness flooding out of his body onto the floor.  The last thing he heard was Ryla screaming.

Solide
Location: Alpha Wing

Something fucking crazy was happening to Solide.  Ever since coming back from Reiko-7 he had been hit with increasingly strong ‘daydreams’, if you can call those fucking things by such a weak name.  It would be almost as potent or visual as actually seeing it in front of him.  Certain areas would be more potent than others.
He would walk into a room and almost get knocked back by the images of seeing him killing or getting killed by the useless fucks around him.  Or some other room where he would be going one-on-one with one of these damn Death Angels that rarely ended well.  He needed to get the fuck out of here.
The major problem was, he didn’t know what the hell was happening, and had no clue.  His first thought were was something to do with Senses, or as those soft asses in their labs call them, ‘Psionics’.  He had a honed 2nd ‘Pre-intention Manifestation Awareness’ which was a fancy fucking way of saying he had the defensive combat Sense of physically feeling when an attack was aimed at him in a preventative way.  At the moderate levels he possessed, it did little for random bullets, forces of nature and so on, but was a huge boon in his general craft of warfare that as if someone was directly hostile at him he would know what was coming.  It What he was experiencing was not that, and next he thought perhaps it was some of the time Senses.
He knew all about Senses being ‘awoken’ in life or death situations, but he had been tested enough in labs, as well as real life, that there was little chance of anything new coming out of him.  That was a major reason why this was so confusing to him.
He had been assigned with some of those whack Chrono fucks before, and he had actually talked to them about what it was like.  It was always the same shit about ‘doors’ and ‘tunnels’ and limited choices and falling through rooms and lights being on.  Surprised they aren’t in some mental place or just recycled already.  Regardless, what was happening to him had little to do with much of that beyond that he would be physically triggered by some doors or rooms but did not think that is what they were talking about.
“You…”  Solide wasted very little time talking or thinking, pulling up Claim Jumper and firing it one handed at the female who was a major cause of these problems.  He was sure he had put the bitch down, but given the images, he was not unprepared to see her.  There was no one left at the base, the others had left, and this was a clone or whatever these aliens were.
Her left side got thrust back, hit from the round perhaps.  He shot twice more, the loud burst of sound exploding down the empty, dim hallway.  She didn’t move this time.
Her head was tilted down, hair covering her face as she started laughing.
‘What the fuck…?’ Solide thought as he pulled the weapon into his shoulder and took a better firing position as he fired more rounds at her.  Convinced that something was wrong when she stood there unmoving, he turned partly, blasting the wall  as the metal cratered and sparked from the impact.  
He put his shotgun down.  W, what the hell was happening here?
“What the fuck are you?”
“You know me as Rox.,”  She turned and smiled at him gently.
“I killed you, bitch!”  Panic started coming into his mind;, she was a fucking Death Angel.  He had seen them before:, they could take Solarian form but acted on some upper dimension.  It took entire heavily armed teams to put them down.
Her eyes sloped down  in confusion. , “You did?”  She lifted her arms, looking around. , “I seem to be quite fine.”
Solide was confused initially why the first round seemed to knock her to the side, but she had no actual damage from a weapon capable of heavy destruction.  Fuck…this was just like Elyria.  The bitch acted the exact same way of ‘oh tee-hee excuse me~’ while she ripped elite soldiers apart.
He shot a few more times, trying to gauge if luck was at all on his side and this was a wounded one he might be able to take.  She showed no sign of anything.  “What the hell are you!?” h He shouted, lifting his weapon one-handed at her.
“Oh my…are you trying that again?”
Solide did not understand what was happening here; he had encountered a Death Angel before and killed it at the loss of his whole team.  The damage they sustained was nothing like expected but they did take it.  He realized it could be detected by the blue gas blown off of them.  Yet, what was this thing?
Rox grinned. , “Ttry it once more,” she taunted.  “I  think it might work.”
Solide obliged, pulling the trigger.  The magnetically propelled shards spreading out much akin to its ancestral weapon of a shotgun taken to magtec levels met her face in fractions of an instant.  This time was much like the first when he had killed her when her face and head disintegrated backwards, covering the ceiling and hallway behind her in blood.  Her body fell unceremoniously backwards.
He watched for a moment, taking a grenade and priminged it before tossing it on her body, blowing it apart and adding to athe growing level of gore the base was acquiring as meat covered the floor.
He had no idea what ‘Rox’ was, perhaps an android clone or something.  T, the next thing to do would be go track down her other body , that would give him some answers.
He turned and started walking away, his shadow cast long by the flames burning out from the grenade.
A sharp pain burst forth from his chest, a small arc of blood ploppinged forward out of him.  He staggered for a second, looking down and seeing his face looking back at him.  He was looking at hisa reflection on a bloody piece of metal sticking through his heart.
“What…”  He slowly turned his head left, taking it in shaky stages before , seeing Rox’s face leaning on his left shoulder.
She triumphantly pulled the knife out of his chest, pushing him to the floor.  He fell face down.  Panic going coursed through him.  T, the bitch knew exactly where to hit and severed his aorta, his nanites triggering in vain to try to restructure such athe vital organ but he knew this was likely the end.
She put her boot under his shoulder, rolling him over as she looked down at him.
“I don’t expect you to understand.  I don’t think you are the best to learn either,” she sighed, closing her eyes.  Solide moved his hand over his heart, his nanites doing their damnedest but he knew he was N-Limiting.  Fuck…this is how it ends…to some crazy bitch he didn’t understand what she was.
“Unfortunately the Fate Lines seem like this is a preferred path.,”  Sshe shook her head. , “Really unfortunate.  M, maybe it just needs to back fracture enough to put us on a different one.”  She opened her eyes smiling.  “You will find this situationally ironic, but I really hate resorting to violence.  However,  but I think it’s the fastest way you are going to learn.”
“…Bi…tch…”
She lifted the bloody knife up.,  “Let me end your suffering, noble Solide.,”  Sshe stabbed down and slashed across, ending him in a red rupture.

Solide
Location: Reiko-10, Bunkered Room

Solide did not like what was happening here.  It was too much like Elyria Modality.  He went through the stupid little motions of moving furniture and various things to try to bunker in this base, knowing that if it triggered the only real thing that mattered then there would be was huge amounts of fire power and hoping he was one of the few survivors after the Death Angels rips them all apart.
He had been placed in this shitty little planet all because it was pretty clear it was Death Angel zone,; not he wasn’t sure what that meant but it seemed they were able to figure out where they would come.  How fucking cute it was his life that was the bait to lure out these creatures that could probably kill ships by themselves.
Beyond how messed up all of that was, there were increasingly strong indications he was going through some sort of psychological event.  He was extremely mentally stable, believe it or not, but something recent had occurred.  It started this morning when they went to Reiko-7 to see it burned out.  He knew what he would find.  It was a bit confusing though because it seemed too predictable for what he found.  It made him pause for a moment;, he could have sworen he had seen this before.  
That is where the problem was.  H, he had seen so many destroyed things in his life, and surviving through Elyria Modality of course was a near clone of what likely occurred on Seven7.  So perhaps it was just memories of what he had seen in the past, but it didn’t seem right.
He knew too many things:, that med bitch and ol’ Kalco were going off alone; t.  That dog bitch would find some alien artifact and hide it, which he still was going to punish that traitor for; h.  e kKnew fire fighter boy and Madigan headed to the deepest part.  All maybePerhaps all could be hand waved away, except when he got back here he started seeing visions of himself torn apart by creatures or others.
It disturbed him, and the first time he turned, ready to fight only to find nothing there.
“Excuse me.,”  Ryla had come up to him, and dropped some boxes to fill in a hole on the bunker.  
Solide grabbed her wrist,.  “Do you know something?”
She looked shocked, and fire guy looked over at him with a wariness in his face a non-soldier rarely has.
“Uh…what?”
He shoved her wrist away.  He came up with something to cover for his action. , “I was hoping you kneow something about fighting,.  I don’t like our odds here.”
“Sorry, I don’t fight.”
He thought it was perhaps his 2nd Sense being activated at a higher level, a.  As it bore a loose similarity of a warning aspect.  It was not exactly the same because if someone was going to hit him from behind, he could feel that happening before it actually did, but to see himself torn apart by Death Angels?  No, that wasn’t how the 2nd worked.
“Hey help me with the Wes table.,”  Tthe fire guy waved Solide over.  
“Railine, you two need help?”  Ryla asked.  Like that little girl could help, but Solide appreciated her enthusiasm.
The table was a three dimensional version of Pool and a lot of people got really good at it.  H, he personally hated the game, it was too complicated for him.  Glad that piece of shit could be used for something useful for once.  He came and together the likely two strongest men on the base and the little girl lifted the heavy metal Wes table out of the rec room and drug it over, flipping it on its side to make a fairly solid wall in the makeshift shelter they were constructing.
It crashed loudly, and they leaned against it for a moment collecting their breath.  Solide looked over at Railine leaning forward on the very heavy table and was breathing hard and noticed a number ‘120’ written in marker on Railine’s hand.
“What the hell is that?”  Solide pointed at his hand.
Railine retracted it very quickly.,  “Nothing.”
“What the fuck was that!?”
Solide’s mind worked fast and he was pretty aware of his surroundings.  That guy never had a number tattooed on his burnt hand before, so why would he have it now?  Given all the deaths of himself he had seen something really fucking weird was clicking and that guy may have some answer for him.
“It’s a verse out of a book, a reminder to be brave.”
Solide knew he was lying, but there was little point to making a scene.
“Something wrong?”  Ryla had come up to him.  She was like a little sister perhaps to him, triggering some ancient instinct in him, but that did not stop him from wanting to fuck her.  Her little butt was just so tight, and her breasts looked great on her small body.
He grabbed her wrist. , “Come with me, I need help moving something.,”
She pulled back. , “Fine, you don’t need to be so forceful.”
They were deep in Delta wing, when he turned to her,.  “Is something weird going on here?”
“Of course.,”  wWithout wind blowing, her long ribbon on the left side of her head hung flat down her medium length hair.
“No, like really weird.  Y, you got any bad feelings about this?”
“Not especially.”  This bitch was being coy.
He grabbed her shoulders. , “Wwhat the fuck is going on here!?”
She pushed him back with a strength that little girl should not have.  “Watch yourself, Solide.”
He shot out his left hand, gripping her bicep and was not going to let go.  S, she grabbed it with her other hand and started crushing his hand  until he retracted it.
“What the hell?”
Her tone was colder than the soft girl ever used, “I have endured both your lecherous thoughts, your overt hostility, and insufferable gutter tongue because I can feel what is in your heart, but you had better focus if you are to survive what is coming here.”
He might have asked something similar to ‘what are you?’ but instead a huge grin started coming over his face.  
“What?”  she asked, c.  Confused by his response.
“My little Ryla.  N, not just some little girl after all.”
“You’re wrong.”
He dropped his plan for a moment, and asked herwent on, “Something strange is happening.  I have seen this before, and I don’t believe I have time Senses, but I have seen my death in various ways.  It starts out there, involving Rox or Laina.”
Ryla dropped the innocent school girl act as she replied.,  “You do not possess Chrono Psionics?”
“No, that’s what I fucking said.  No way that shit ‘awoke’ or whatever either, trust me.  But I’ve seen this shit before.  S, something really weird is going down here.  Even if I kill people, we all end up dead.”
“Do not kill anyone then.”
Solide shook his head fast,.  “Can’t, one of them is infected.  I think it’s Laina and Rox. Laina kills us all if I shoot Rox first.  If I kill Laina everyone turns on me.”
Ryla lowered her face into a hand. , “Hmm, this is interesting.  My Psionics are definitely hitting a blank state in the near future here.  What could you be seeing that I am not?”
So the little bitch was some sort of psi freak or some shit, given her loose lips.  Ha, this keeps getting better.
He grabbed her, but when she went to grab his wrist, he retracted. , “What the hell are you?  If we are going to get through this you need to tell me.”
“It is best if you don’t know.  I am a girl with advanced Psionics.”
“Psionics don’t boost physical strength.”  He knew Star Priestesses were very strong for their thin frames, but they were amped off Aelisha tech;, Ryla wasn’t a Priestess that was for sure.
“Maybe you don’t know all of them.”
She was perhaps right, but Solide knew better than most what the known Priestesses were about.  “You are either with me, or against me.  I need to know.”  His mind was already cycling about how he would shoot Laina first this time as soon as he got back, and then turn on Rox.
With that thing on his wrist, maybe scarface had this same thing happening to him.  Fire guy must be living through the same shit;, they could talk it out after he got the jump on those two Death Angels or whatever the fuck they were.
“I am Solarian, Solide.”
It was a bad flash back to Elyria Modality, almost the same line in a lot of ways.
He knew he could not consider his action for even a moment if she possessed the right Sense, and without a second thought pulled out Claim Jumper and fired it at her.  She was good, and had dodged mostly out of the way.  It scrapped her arm.  And by scrape, the magnetically propelled shards tore through her flesh to where her bone would be, blowing her shoulder open.
She turned to the side from the hit and turned slowly back to face him.  No cry, no gasp, just methodically looking at the injury.  The huge gap in her arm had small, barely visible cords lash out from one side to the other as it stretched across the rended flesh as it was like a fishing reel pulling the destroyed landscape back as one coherent piece.  In the space of a few breaths her shoulder that had been partially blown off had restrung itself, filled out, and the flesh looked like soft girl flesh once again except for the jacket that was missing.
“We could have worked together.,”
Solide shook his head, taking a step back,.  “I highly doubt that.”
He readied another shot at her, when she dashed at him, holding her hand like a knife strike and stabbed straight at his heart.  Her hand might as well have been a real knife for how easily in pieced his flesh, blowing a portion of his heart out the backside.  H, he collapsed death dead within moments, thinking ‘what the fuck was she?’

Solide
Location: Alpha Wing

He was going to turn the corner but had a vague inclination that there would be someone there.  When he turned and saw it was Rox his reaction was to shoot that bitch dead.  But on some level he knew it was pointless.  He turned and ran;, no way she saw him.  She was some sort of alien bitch, just like the rest of these fuckers.
He needed to find Ryla,; he knew she would come with him.  She had potential, and was least likely to be infected.  Running away from Rox, he looked back to make sure she hadn’t seen him when he ran into something hard.  He snapped forward, seeing what should not have been there, instinctually pulling his gun and shooting at her.
She shook her head mournfully, lifting her hand and as a weapon materialized in themit.  She did not allow him much time to wonder what was happening when she leveled it at him and he was vaporized out of the universe.  Never again would Solide think one profanity  or have a single simple desire.

Solide
Location: Alpha Wing

Something strange was going on here.  He knew exactly who he was going to see around this corner, despite that he had killed her a day ago.  He walked calmly around it to confirm indeed it was Rox standing there.  On some level he knew fighting her was a mistake, despite having recently destroyed her, something had changed.  
“What the hell is going on here?”
“My,” she put her hand on her hip, “wWho would have thought you of all people were one of the faster ones?  That’s what makes this so fun to me.”
“Why do I feel like if I attack you I die?”
“Maybe it’s happened?”  She raised an arm in a ‘maybe?’ type of motion.
“What the fuck are you?”
“Well if I told you an angel that would not be right, as we actually have one of those here!”  She laughed at her own joke.
Solide turned away.  , hHe was not dealing with this, he was not going to die to some alien clone or android.
“Wait!” s She yelled.,  “You mess up the Line this way!  You die, Solide!”
He dashed out of the hallway, running the hell away from her.  He crashed through a door and realized the mistake when the four of them turned around on him.
“Traitor!”
“It’s not fucking me…!”  Zaier’s burst hit him through his legs.  His heavy armor deflected a majority at his torso but the hits in the leg caused him to stagger, then go down.  “It’s one of those fucks next to you!”
Solide knew it was not Zaier while on base, he did not know how given that he interacted with him so little, but was sure of this fact.  It was someone in that group.
Zaier looked at Laina, and she shrugged.,  “Solide dodged the blood test, and shot the machine before I could take it myself.,  I think that says all we need to know.”  He Zaier looked back at Solide, the targeting matrix on the rifle adjusting for his head.  Zaier pulled the trigger without thinking twice.

“I am what you may call a Gatekeeper of sorts.  I judge whether you are worthy of being able to continue on.  Y, you must answer these questions honestly if I am to actually weigh your soul.  Answer wrong, and I will be forced to punish you.  There will be three questions of increasing difficulty.”  He pulled the trigger at her.  T, the round definitely came out, but it went right through her.  In the next instant, she had teleported next to him, and was holding the barrel of the weapon upwards.  “Now now, do I need to take your toy away from you?  Next time you get punished.”  She was back at the other side of the room, her arms crossed, and one arm was upwards as she was resting her chin on her fist.
Solide stood there, really wanting to fire at her again but apparently it was useless.  He was frowning and bitting his lip.  “I answer honestly?”
“To start, what is your name?”
“Braid.”
She grinned.,  “Interesting, you answered the trick question correctly.  Next, what is your goal here?”
“To get the fu…to get out of here.”
She nodded slowly, as if she was weighing his soul right now.  He wondered if he messed up by almost swearing, or by going back to repeat his answer.
“Lastly, what isf your favorite color?”
“Black.”
She nodded one final time.  “Right.  Well, off you go!”  She got out of his way, bowed and held her hands towards the door.  “Be careful up ahead.”
“I think I’ll go back the way I came…”
He walked backwards, watching her carefully the whole time.  She never stood up, and he went straight into the other room.  His thoughts were still on the strange encounter, and did not see the creature that slashed at him.  His Senses warned him somewhat that it was only a ‘glancing’ blow - if one that was causing him to bleed out could be labeled as  such instead of an instant life ender.
As he was dying, he reached for his ReNew pak and felt hope drop away when he saw it was broke apart in the attack.  The last thing he really thought of at all before it attacked him again, was that girl’s dumb game.

Solide
Location: Alpha Wing


Vague sensations were slowly becoming more clear to him.  As if seeing an image flashed for a fraction of a moment enough times eventually would imprint the actual picture in his mind, he could tell something was occurring.  He knew there were two options for him, if this made any sense at all; and on this option he would be meeting Rox, a woman he blew away yesterday, convinced she was an alien.
He turned the corner peacefully, and she was already there, wavinged girlishly at him.
“What the fuck, you crazy bitch!  You keep killing me!”
“Wow.,”  Sshe smiled earnestly despite the serious comment.  “The speed you are picking this up is insane, it truly is.”
“What the hell is going on…?”  He started backing up away from her.
“You can’t interfere right now…”  She stepped forward
“Wait, wait!”  He had seen this in his dreams, she would teleport right next to him and he would be dead.
“Ha, don’t worry, I am not going to kill you, this Fate Line is shot already.  Madigan died  and the reactor is going to melt down.”
“Who the hell is it?  There are traitors…no…whatever these things are, they are in our midst.”
“The sad thing is, I can tell you and you won’t remember.”
“Try me.”
“OkVery well..it’s…”

Solide
Location: Alpha Wing

He was walking, about to turn the corner when a strong feeling of having been here before hit him.  That crazy bitch Rox was still alive, and was telling him something he couldn’t remember.  Damn, maybe all his battles had fucked up his brain pretty bad.  He just needed to find Ryla and get out of here.  Take the V-Plane and go to another Reiko base and get the fuck off this planet.
Turning the corner, a woman he killed was standing there.
“I told you.”
“Told me what?” h He asked the thing he had shot the face off of yesterday.
She laughed. , “Ooh nothing.”
“Despite my inclination to shoot you, that seems pointless.”
“It is.  For a lot of reasons.  Regardless, we are at an impasse for a while.  Do you want to have sex while we are waiting?  A lot of the others aren’t getting it nearly as fast, there are too many divergences.”
Solide looked at her suspiciously.  W, what was wrong with this girl?  And why wasn’t he just shooting her?
“We have had variations of this before…”  Solide said carefully.
“Yeah…this is a really bad fracture, mixed in with the MalAxl infestation…I am not sure we can get out of this.”  Solide did not comprehend everything she said, but she continued.  “Given the absolute divergence of Fate Lines here, and that there are ten key players in this story, you are getting it pretty fast.  Unfortunately, your role comes later, and it has to be opened up properly first.”
“What the hell are you saying?”
“Well, one thing is it’s nice you aren’t shooting me, or me being forced to kill you.  So want to have sex?”
“No.”  He walked away.
“You will regret that.”
“Doubt it.”

Days later when it was obvious the reactor was melting down and the core would detonate and render a large portion of the planet uninhabitable, Solide had two major thoughts.  He couldn’t believe out of all the battles he got through he was dying to something so fucking stupid as the energy plant melting down.  Second was he should have fucked that girl, since they were all dying anyway.  That bitch had a nice ass.

							~*~ 

Solide
Location: Solide’s room, Living Quarters

Railine had the number 18xx 1800 something on his hand when Solide saw him earlier.  He tried to not think much about it, because the number felt a lot higher, and he didn’t care to keep track.  Might make him more crazy than he was.
“Madigan can’t be allowed to leave, he will die,” Rox explained.
“He has to fix the reactor.”  The fact that Solide was talking about an eventuality to something inconceivable didn’t seem that strange.
“Right…”  She sighed contently, her warm body next to Solide.  To him, as crazy as this seemed on some fucked up level, it made a lot of sense why he would be having sex with a girl he just killed ‘yesterday’.
“Why are we even doing this?  You claim it feels good, but that doesn’t make sense.”
“To bond with you on a deeper level, as a Solarian, subconsciously this is the preferred way.”
He was not convinced. , “Is that it?”
“No…what if you were stuck in this alone?  Imagine the mental damage,.  I act as a type of psycho therapy for your mind.”  Her answer was surprisingly serious for her, it made a lot of sense.  He did not feel nearly as alone.  He was not predisposed to having flashbacks…actually as soon as he said thought that, he realized it was not true.  He flash backed a lot.  He suddenly looked at womean who was getting physical with him again, considering knowing there was something much deeper going on here that he did was not have flashbacks any more.
Being naturally suspicious, he wondered if she was in fact just some grand architect’s bone they were tossing him.  Was Rox just an agent sent to pacify Solide so he could get something accomplished?  Damn it…he feell for one of the lowest tricks…sex.
“Your synch rate is going down…” Rox said.  “You don’t trust me.”
“I don’t trust anyone.”
“That’s why no one trusts you.”  She had sat up in the bed, her naked breasts hung there, full and waiting, glinting with sweat.
“You are using me.”
“Is that what you think?”  She looked mad.
“I am stuck in some fucking time loop, and you are some type of higher being, and you are coming here, getting killed and fucked by me?  How is that at all productive!?”
“You are acting like you understand anything beyond what you can see,” she said back.
He slapped her.  “What the hell am I supposed to do?  Do you know what it is like to die?  To die over and over by…by all those fucks out there that don’t trust me!?”
God damn it…he put his face in his hands and started having flashbacks to all the close calls he had before this.  Back when death was ‘for real’ instead of this inverted nightmare where he could not kill himself to get out of it.  Betrayed and set up, and all the bodies he had stacked in his quest for vengeance.  What was it all for?
“I am here for you Solide, you must believe that.”  She had crawled over and was hugging him.
His eyes were dazed.  H, he was lost in some battle somewhere, the shotgun shells were piling around him but they were not enough…not enough…
“Would you prefer I just hold you?” she asked.
He lowered his hands.  W, whatever he was thinking of had happened a long time ago.  After a thousand deaths it had blurred together what was ‘real’ back then and what occurred now.  He might have been close to a mental breakdown right then.  Maybe having this woman helped.  She was there for way more than just it seemed.  They engaged in sex because it was what he liked, it didn’t mean it would be the same for someone else.
He grabbed her and the two of them fell backwards fully onto the bed and started escalating.
“Uh…ahh…”  hHer breath came in gasps.…  “God…keep going…”  Tthey stopped talking about serious matters for a while.  In a way they both knew this hedonism was pointless, but at this stage there was nothing else.  He would quickly learn to appreciate things the same way she did, that her stupid rambling of the joy of embodiment made a lot of sense from the perspective of what they endure.  He sympathized in a way he was surprised he could; he barely understood the workings here and to someone that did, the slowness of the way things were unfolding must be unbearable.
She was rubbing her hand up and down his chest as they lay in the locked bedroom.  It didn’t matter who was getting killed where, or what was happening, w.  What personal horrors and trials others had, because this was a shot Line like Rox had said in the past.
Solide’s role came later and because the initial condition seed was that no one trusted him it did not matter what he said as it would be dismissed.  He knew because he tried about a hundred different ways.
“The problem is…no one trusts me.”
“Doesn’t mean you can’t still help,” she said.
“If Madigan is alive, he repairs the reactor?” a Asked Solide.  H, he thought he knew, which seemed like the answer was ‘no’ but that didn’t make sense.
“No, it never happens if he lives.  It never gets sabotaged because they know he would fix it.”
Solide shook his head.,  “Interesting.”
She rubbed him more, her hand going lower. , “Wwhoa, ready for round two already?”
Before he allowed her to commence he stated to her simply, “It’s obvious I have to try to stop it .”
She sighed and only stalled for a moment, “Yyou are welcome to try, but the Fate Lines don’t evolve right.”
“Why?”
“Your reputation is reset.  I, it’s always as it was when it fractures back.  So everything you know now, everything you could explain is useless.  They will think you are snapped, or that something is suddenly wrong with you.  The ‘swearing, angry badass now talking about time fractures and upper dimensional creatures’.”
“I just need to try harder.”
“Won’t work,” Rox said,; her toned body felt good to him.  He hadn’t enjoyed a woman’s company in a long time.  How ironic given the death around him that is what he would be doing right now.
“I will just predict the ‘future’, then they will believe me.”
“There are certain key events that need to happen,.  Ryla has prove to herself she can win without violence for example.  The only way that happens is if she realizes it herself.”
Dying over a thousand times had changed Solide so that the talk of killing a woman he was having sex with was not that much of a cognitive distortion.  “I don’t want to kill you anymore.”
“It’s necessary for many of the Line evolutions.  I don’t think it ends that way, and it’s not like I actually die.”
“Still…What about me just predicting stuff?”
“You tried.  You are stubborn so I know you will try more.”
Solide was frustrated. , “I don’t get it, it changes slightly each time.”
Rox nodded, the beads in her hair bouncing as she slowly started bouncing her body more and more on Solide.  “You have potentially nine major Will actors here, so each reset brings a different knowledge to the past and how they act on it.”
“Ah…yeah…keep going…”  Hher legs tightened around him on command,.  “Jjust one more thing, you said nine, but there is ten of us excluding the dogs.”
“Yeah I misspoke.”  She loved this so much;, being given a body was the rarest of pleasures.
“So ten?”
“No, I am not a Will actor, I can’t influence Lines meaningfully.  Technically I guess there is one…two…uh depending on how you count Axl Affinities to those capable of willing Junction changes, maybe three or fourish.  Regardless, that still leaves about half of everyone here.  That’s why you can’t pick a perfect path as it changes each time very slightly due to various Line Junctions preferences being willed.”
“So, here’s something I’ve been thinking about.  You tell me how you can’t influence anything.  D, didn’t you start this whole thing, taking that weapon from 7 among other things?”
She giggled. , “Iis that how you see it?  Did you forget that you shot me of your own volition?”
“You were acting suspicious.  I reacted to you.”
Smiling softly, she sighing as she did not want to talk about this compared to what she wanted to do.  “You are wrong, those were your own inclinations.  Anyone else acts different in exact same circumstance.”
He could have argued with her about theat ‘she brought the gun!’ logic, but perhaps she was right.  He was too quick on the trigger due to having zero trust of anyone from as a result of the Elyria Modality.  Fate/Destiny/whatever the fuck it was he was in was far too intricate for him at this point to understand.
Rox was either masterfully manipulating him, which was definitely a case,; or his own tendencies had written the ending before he could act it out.
As complicated as that might have once been to him, dying a few times had the fortunate effect of teaching him pretty rapidly.  He didn’t understand all of that, but on a deep level got a lot of it.  He lifted his rough hands to her soft breasts as she smiled with a silly look on her face.  “Hmmph…I got just one thing to say.”
“What?”
“Give it to me as hard as you can, I like it rough too.”
She smiled as they got to it in a strange uncaring way despite the struggles and death around them.

Solide
Location: Solide’s room, Living Quarters

Solide had started the very next fracture, convinced Rox was wrong.  All it would take ist kill the initial True Form, or the source of the infection, or the traitor.  Armed with what he had to do, it was pretty easy to figure out the source of how this was occurring; and but the team fell apart into mistrust and continued  killing each other.
Yet, nothing he could do would end the loops.  
The problem was, as he slowly understood from his own awareness and talking to his good friend Rox, there was a hard preferential path through the first day, and at for whatever reason Solide could not unseat it.  No matter what he did, everything spiraled into disaster anyway.  The bomb was already primed and he could do nothing to stop it.
Even stopping any of the origins did nothing.  He was convinced shooting this, or killing that would end it.  But it never did, in most cases he was killed by the team he was trying to save, or he would hide, and wait out the loop.  It never mattered.  O, overt actions out of him only had negative effects as it sowed distrust far too early into everyone else.  Subtle things like trying to change people’s paths or intentions had interesting effects but in general did little to change anything.  He realized how deep this part of the Fate Line was laid down.
Once he shot Feyria in flight.  Another time he brought some rigged explosives he made, and detonated them over the icy mountains, killing everyone.  Every time he would wake up on day zero of this nightmare.
Perhaps the best lesson he was learning was the subtle awareness of tapping into the Emotion Field so he could actually remember more and more of past iterations of this.  He would never remember the first, as they were lost, so much as he could hold onto more of the recent ones.  In  a way he was getting ‘smarter’ by realizing his intuition had lived lives he had died.
Rox had many conversations with him recently about him being a ‘will actor’ and was one of several here, and that it was because there were more than one stuck in this fracture that it was so hard to get out of.  Then there was the problem of those that, when they were in contact with MalAxls, woke up to a different reality.  It was all very complicated but on some levels simple.  On Solide’s side Ryla was one, but had yet to ‘wake up’ so to say, whereas there were at least two on the other.   
He had stopped the origin before, but it didn’t matter.  His ‘unusual’ behavior or going against Zaier’s orders stared a train of distrust that meant even if everyone made it back to R-10 unfazed the suspicion eventually led to someone acting out which they led to the rest dying.
This pattern was hard to avoid, and entirely painful that he had to let ‘Eve’ go when he fully knew that each and every loop would mean them dying in gruesome ways; yet stopping ‘Eve’ at time zero did nothing to progress the other’s knowledge.  He was not patient at all, and was condemned to thise irony of the more he meddled, the more slowslower it inevitably progressed anywhere.
He quickly abandoned this avenue after about the hundredth time despite Rox’s insistence it was pointless even the first time.  The narrative went something like:
A.  Solide acting suspicious at Reiko-7 and/or stopping ‘Eve’ various ways:

    B1: Kalco wary/hostile about Solide being with him/Laina
        C1: Kalco or Railine attacks Solide, one or more die.
        C2: Others think an ‘alliance’ of Solide/Kalco/Laina is formed and they kill the three.  How stupid, as he hated Laina before this happened.
        C3: Laina poisoned Solide a few times…that was a painful way to go.
        C4: Tied and left somewhere, dying later to reactor meltdown

    B2: Feyria openly criticizes/rallies against Solide
        C1: Hard alliance of Solide, Madigan, Aria, Railine forms, eventually killed.  He kind of liked that  crew.
        C2: Bitch lured him on the V-Plane a few times and crashed it.  That surprised him.
        C3: Madigan surprisingly defends Solide and starts fight with girls.  Madigan had some style to him.  O, once he got a shotgun in his hand, and women as his target he racked up some kills due to some past hate.
        C4: He gets left at some off-base location and freezes or eventually wakes up back in this loop.

    B3: Ryla becomes too scarred/ Zaier lashes out at defiance
        C1:  Zaier gets hard alliance, Solide gets death by firing-squad.  He hated when Zaier was around, as it almost always led to him dying.
        C2:  Ryla crying evokes Railine or Kalco to try it , one or more die.  This was a lot like B1C1 but was a distinctly different path, implying to Solidethat similar ends could happen with different pathinginitial paths.
        C3:  Unceremoniously drug to old shack and electrocuted to death.  He died a lot in that place, but liked it otherwise because he could be alone.
        C4:  For some reason they think his is the alien and  he’s, burned alive a few times.  He had a new respect for Railine having been through a fire and the facial/body scars he has for his whole life.

What seemed evident from ‘slamming into the walls’, as people with Chrono Senses say all the time, was that there was no way out of that action.  At this point it was pretty obvious he didn’t have any Chrono Senses,; he was trapped in some sort of time or consciousness loop.  He did not ‘see’ what was coming so much as lived it and remembered it.  Because each subtle new action he took left him blind, he did not ‘see’ the door or hallway or whatever the fuck it is.  
The group of four apparently had to leave, because trying to stop them had not gotten anywhere.  This was better anyway at it seemed about 100% of the time Zaier was around on base. that Solide would end up shot by him;, ironic how often it was Kalco or Railine he butted heads with or didn’t like.  Little bitch evidently long desired a reason to kill him.
The problem was, as many times as he tried this, none of them came close to the right answer.  Like Rox had warned him so long ago, he knew the moves, but at this point could not make them and merely had to watch.  He had to watch them choose things that would lead to theirs deaths.  He had to dutifully pull the trigger on Rox time after time to trigger that Chrono Line, so whatever lesson might get passed on down that thread.

Solide
Location: Solide’s room, Living Quarters

The number on Railine’s hand had ‘recently’ passed 2000.  Solide told himself he didn’t want to look, but every time they built that damn bunker it was easy to see when he would place things down in a certain way.  He had started to become much more serious about trying to figure something out.
He had never not been serious about survival, but there was some physics or religious shit going on here that he was realizing he needed to piece together.
“So what are you?” h He asked the dimensional being ‘Rox’ in front of him.
“You may not easily understand,.  I don’t say that insultingly, but perhaps it might be easiest to call me a ‘Divine Being’  of sorts.  Some use the term ‘LineGod’, that’s kind of cool.”
“A god?”
“Not as one may conventionally think.”
“But look,” he poked Rox’s chest, her breasts were large like the way he liked them, “being able to change your body on a whim isn’t normal.”
“I do this because it makes you more happyhappier,.  Iit’s a pretty easy trick for higher synch rates.”  She sighed. , “Tthe problem is, I can synch as high as I can with you, and because of the way the Line Fracture is developing, there is nothing to do.  Your own personality was not trusted going into the loop, thus that is the initial condition each time.”
Solide looked away from her, his hand mechanically massaged her naked breast but was thinkingas he thought of other things,.  “It confuses me.  W, we have had sex so many times in these loops.  Because it’s a ‘new day’ so to say I am always ready…but…”
Her face frowned deeply. , “Am I not good enough for you?  Want me to make them bigger, or change my butt?  How about short hair again for a bit?”  She almost pleaded.  “Aelisha fox ears?  Rahhh~!”
“No.”  Solide sat up, his naked muscular body had tainted with the faintest of pink scars on it.  Nanites healed nearly any injury so scars rarely happened, but it was a side-effect of the most severe injuries, namely dismemberments or similar injuries where new tissue had to be created and the ‘scar’ was merely the evidence of the joining of the original body with the new - a weld or seam of the biologic variety that could not be gotten around as a bug of sorts in the age of steady states from the nanites perspective.
He held his head in his hands, massaging his eyes.  Time loops had some really fucked up consequences, such as if he was tired, sore, or something was hurt at the start of the loop, he had that fucking thing the entire time, which was the case here.  To think he should have backed off on training a bit and went to bed early…of all the fucking times to not be at peak condition.  What a fucking joke.
“I don’t get it at all,” he began, “I feel like we have grown really close in this fucked up way, yet…it’s not even about sex.  I am trapped in this fucking loop and the crushing endlessness of it is driving me crazy.  I have you, you are fun, you can change into any type of girl I want to fuck, and you love it all, and I don’t even have responsibility to try anything because of the way the Fate Lines are – both according to you and my own attempts – yet I grow tired of it.  I don’t understand how you remember way more than me on each back fracture, you ‘live’ forever and don’t get tired of this.”
She giggled, sitting up and cuddling him.  Solide had long gotten past the very strange point that this woman was some sort of ethereal being merely taking the form of a girl, but it took a while.  Having some ‘god’ hug him while they were both naked paled in comparison to the fucked up Fate Line fracture he was stuck in while his compatriots killed each other over and over while he stayed out of it until it was his time to play a role later in the Chrono Tunnel.
Her answer was simple, because to her it was,.  “We perceive time far differently, but the easiest way to explain would be that I perceive eternity and as long as this seems to you, it is such a blink of an eye that I enjoy every moment of it and it will be over before I know it.”
“Eternity…I can’t even think about that.”
“No, you can’t.  There is a cute metaphor I heard from Solarians before.  I, it goes something along the lines of a dove taking one grain of sand from the tallest mountain and flying to the farthest beach, and that after every grain of sand has been transported that still is shorter than eternity.  Or maybe it was taking the sand from the beach to the mountains…Something like that.”
“ ‘Something like that’…you don’t even remember the story.”
She playfully hit him,.  “Come on, sands, doves flying, mountains, eternity, all the key parts are there.”
There was a crashing at the door, and a large claw slashed partway into the doormetal.  Solide jumped a moment, his eyes flashing for Claim Jumper;, this happened occasionally on some of the loops.
“Don’t worry.”  Rox lifted her hand and blue diagonal diamond shapes appeared in the air and shot forward through the door.  The door was not damaged, but there was a wet popping sound on the other side of the door.
“Stuff like that takes me out of the mood too,” he said.
“Get over here, you silly boy…”  Sshe grabbed his wrist and pulled him back to the bed.
“I don’t get it either, you can unleash insane power like that, yet you claim you normally are restricted despite your desire.”
“That doesn’t aeffect the Fate Line.  I, it’s an inverse proportion as I have told you.”  She leaned close to him.,  “This loop will not work either so…”
He swung his head towards her.,  “Ccan you split into two people?”
“Easy!” s Said a new Rox to his right.
“Haha!  I think this could entertain me for a couple more loops.  All in the name of ‘synch rate’ or ‘harmony’ right?”  Solide asked with sarcasm.
“Of course,.” b Both Roxs answered in complete sincerity .

Kalco 
Location: Ancient Ship
	
He was tThe hero of the story, though maybe  not be the hero of this chapter.  That was okay though, he was still the main hero, naturally.  He possessed above-average Psionics, especially in the Combat branch, mixed with a natural intellect if he did say so himself.  Together, those two things told him there was something wrong happening.  
He looked around the V-Plane at the four others he was with,: Feyria was obliviously flying, Madigan was brooding like usual, Zaier looked as disturbed as he could for hise expressionless face, and Solide  who had begged to come looked far more eager than he normally did.
This scene seemed similar in a lot of ways.  Normally he might just let it go, but he knew he was here for a reason.  After e, escaping Elyria, and after seeing the Mutated Figures here, he knew what was happening.  He was twirling his pistol and saw his pinky finger hanging a bit limply.  He put his weapon down, and grabbed and shifted the finger, popping it back into the right joint.  He disliked a fourth finger ,; they were really superfluous and just prone to breaking off.  
Fortunately, their outer appearance was not that far from Solarians, so it took very few nanite programs to render him ‘Solarian’ in appearance.  Things like hiding the vertical pupil were extremely easy, and other things like removing his tail or ears were more surgical and merely keeping the nanites that wanted to regrow them suppressed.  Man, he missed his fucking tail ;, so many expressions and communication could be used.
A painful realization for the Aelisha was despite their undisputed power on the universal stage, they did not resonate with Line Artifacts.  It was a mystery actually.  All studies showed, painfully, that it was the Daijin Stars and the Solarians that reacted to them the best.  Very few Aelisha could activate them at all, and almost all of them died from some sort of accelerated cellular death.
What Kalco was dealing with here was a very complicated, and a disparate collection of information.  He was high up the ranks of the Aelisha ladder, but there was just so much happening.  There was the Daijin/Burn war, and the attacks of the Solarians, both of which were huge – to state it lightly – issues happening.  Then there was more of this on the ground stuff  level that Kalco specialized in, finding and securing these ‘Gates’, to call them thatreferring to the places where the Mutated Figures and True Forms caome out of.  
There was a loose connection between OOPAs and the presence of the Gates, but not completely, because Terra, the Solarian home world, was loaded with out of place artifacts yet was not open yet.  From the battle maps he had seenaw, there was a distance or limit it appeared as to when these would occur in this early but deadly secret war the Aelisha were engaged in.
“You stay close to me, buddy,.  I’m keeping your ass alive ,” Solide said to Madigan as they were getting out of the stopped plane at this the top of a mountain they had landed at.
“I don’t need your fucking help.”
“Yeah, but we are going to need yours.”
Kalco smirked at the two of them. , “Bbest of buds, how cute.  I prefer more feminine shapes to get close with, myself.”
“Is that why you always have Ryla hanging around you?  That girl is like half your age,” Madigan said.
“Maybe if you ask real nice, I’ll pass her off to you after I am done, and you decide you like girls,” Kalco said.  “A little girl like that is perfect for a ‘big man’ like yourself.”
“Fuck off.”
Thinking of Ryla in a more serious capacity though bothered him.  Ryla had a bit of Xeno allure to her that Kalco sensed.  She didn’t feel like a Solarian, so maybe she was another Aelisha agent?  No…she didn’t really feel like that.
Zaier sized up the situation and the five of them headed into theis tunnel.  It all seemed very familiar to Kalco so despite the act he was putting on, he carefully surveyed the situation.
Kalco knew probably more than he should have, but as an Aesha  his masculine charm helped woeo many a beautiful Aeli into romantic throes and info dumps on him.  Among some of the stuff he had learned, was that there were ruins in the Sol home system that weren’t Aelisha;, Solarians genetic info showed potential tampering beyond the typical AGEd, and had a few stories of various Solarians getting involved with Line Artifacts.  
All well and interesting, but one story he remembered was of some Solarian scientist who blew up some reactor or research lab.  Totally forgettable amidst the constant domestic terrorism fringe colonies usually sustained, but there was an Aelisha agent who was there, or came across the info or something, and the story stood out in some weird ways that made Kalco’s rather sharp mind think he might be in something similar.
The notable thing, was that they had a good record on this guy: no previous military experience, no special training, nothing beyond a typical civilian loosely interested in firearms.  That being stated, he was let go ofremoved from a project, and within a few planet cycles later conducted a perfect military assault with a combat android he picked up from the nearby spaceport  – having never met her in his life.  After an Aeli had told him this story while she was stroking his luxurious tail one night, he went to look up the info himself and was stunned at the guy’s moves.
“Why the fuck are you so close to me?”
“Sorry…”  Solide apologized to Madigan in probably the first time Kalco had ever heard the man say it.  It sounded foreign coming out of his mouth.
The group of five continued onwards into what was quite clearly an original Aelisha ship from the first generation that were legendary.  The things that were piling up here were far too suspicious to be random chance.  The presence of Solide was what really made Kalco think back to this scientist.
Intrigued at the time by the scientist story, Kalco had loaded up every cam and neural net he could of it, w.  Which actually was suspiciously not many.  The thing most suspicious thing about how it all went down was the timing of everything.  Every move, every shot was like an acted script played by only one guy.  His android friend did as well as they always do, but ended up dying along the way, but not him.  His performance was perfect.  Psionics did not even explain his actions as he looked like a trained combatant who had been in a million battles.  He even had high explosives he had received from a retired Solarian Classed Soldier that the scientist had mysteriously been able to convince him to give.  He bombed the place with little warning, was imprisoned, and at some later time escaped and was written off because of the embarrassment of losing a terrorist .
Kalco had become somewhat obsessed by with the story, because it was unlike othersanything else he had heard.  Stories of sleeper agents, and all sorts of hidden indoctrination protocols Solarians had messed with to their own people occurred , but this guy was in all ways normal.  He was the sort of a man after Kalco’s own heart with his pride he walked through life with.  B, but he literally went from a nobody one cycle, to having the right code for an combat android,  and a favor from an ex- Classed to get explosives, and took able to take out a base in a way even Classed teams would be envious of the next.
Most of the upper echelons of Aelisha that saw this story wrote it off that he was perhaps a Drifter alien, or his records were faked and he was actually was some sort of brain-wipe case.  A lot of others thought it was all just a fake dis-info piece to confuse anyone who happened to find it.
One night, staring blearily -eyed at endless neural nets, he came across something shocking.  I, it was from some guard.  I, it was the corner of his viewpoint and barely visible but it showed a woman in a body suit and dark green hair on that guy’s side.
‘Who the fuck is that?!’
He rewound the memory, and there were only a few scenes at all of this woman, and only found one other memory of a different guard that showed her.  This guy had some sort of help, of from an alien or something that apparently was cloaked.  ‘Now we are getting the fuck somewhere!’ h He was elated that his intuition had led him down this path that bordered on obsession.  
The way the entire event went down suggested to Kalco something beyond just soldiering, and it bordered on complete precognition.  Kalco was talking well beyond the Psionic level of precognition as well, as his actions did not line up with how the 7th and 8th Psionic worked in practice.  The answer Kalco settled with, was that this guy’s female alien friend knew the future in a way beyond the highest Psionic and had fed him the information.  It explained a lot, but still left his insane combat skills a question.
This got him thinking, that if this regular guy knew what was coming, or had seen it before, the actions Kalco observed made much more sense.  
Aelisha were objectively the best race around, but Kalco could admit there might be something happening behind the scenes, as evidenced by his mysterious stranger mixed with the subtleties like the OOPAs on Terra and their genetic tampering.
Given all the stories about Ghosts, and past memories, there were tons of other things that implied that the future may be visible in a different way.  His fascination with this one scientist caused him to dive deeper into other things, such as theories of universal recycling, or of reoccurrence.  A pure reoccurrence did not make sense as all actions would be locked, and seemed counter to quantum mechanics, but if there was a reoccur happening, it might be possible that this guy was seeing his own past Ghosts and was changing the Chrono Line.  At this point Kalco admitted he might have fallen off the deep end, and if he approached say an Aelisha Star Priestess about this he would either instantly be made into a Slayer  because of his piercing insight into the deepest workings of reality, or locked up because he knew too much or was too far gone.
Regardless, he got sent into what became Elyria Modality pretty soon after and forgot all about that as he saw first hand about the True Forms and was the only one left to live.  Maybe someone somewhere knew he was getting into things he shouldn’t have been and set him out to die.
The others around him were talking.  His head hurt though, and used one of his hands to massage the corners of his eyes;, something about this felt so similar but different.  Was this like the Solarian he had obsessed over?  Was he feeling some Ghost of himself or someone else who had been through this exact situation?
These first gen ships were a lot shorter.  I, if he had his ears, he would likely be hitting them as he went through every doorway here.  Theyre were in a main area where a mist hung down on the ground, and a light glowed in the corner.  He was looking at the weird little light when he saw movement to the side.  In the corner of his eyes, he saw Solide kneeling, silently priming grenades as he hid them near the doorway.  Kalco swallowed, realizing Solide might be setting some sort of trap.
“Kalco, you okay?”  Feyria asked him, as he was slowly walking backwards to get a better shot at Solide.
“Yeah, headache is all.”
“I have been talking to you and you weren’t responding.”
He really did not want to hear from her right now while he was on the edge of a potential traitor making his move.
“Oh shit!”  Solide said it with what sounded forcedlike a forced proclamation.  , hHe had stepped forward, shoulder ramming Zaier and with a quick move had dashed back.  
Kalco was really confused what Solide was doing until the next moment processed there was a True Form in the room.  Zaier being was knocked away from where an attack had been aimed at, as Solide let his shotgun open up on the creature.  
Kalco was good at battle, and without Solide’s action it would have snapped into combat in mere moments.  B, but seeing Solide was too much like his obsession of the scientist named Trego.  The True Form had shifted and moved in such a way that the previously set grenades went off, consuming it in fire as he continued pumping rounds into the inferno.  
The spray of the shotgun, his stance, and everything reminded him of the last soldier left alive with him on Elyria before he died.  H, he too favored the shotgun as he died bravely to the True Form back then.  Kalco whipped out Aelishun and started firing into the fire.
It did not last long and the two of them held their weapons ready.
“What the fuck was that?”  Madigan screamed.
“Shut up, stay low.”  Solide started creeping slowly back to the group.
Kalco walked over to him, but kept his pistol ready.  “You have seen this before, haven’t you?”  Solide did not look at Kalco.  Kalco grabbed his wrist, pulling the large man to face him,.  “You saw this shit before!  Haven’t you!?”
“Of course I fucking see it!  Don’t you!?”
“Hey, what?  Gah…” The odd words made both of them turn around.  There was a large pink slab sticking through Madigan’s chest.  He looked as shocked as everyone else did.  Kalco saw the True Form to the side and side stepped off the line of Madigan and started firing.  At this point Solide, Zaier, and Feyria understood what was happening and the four of them made a fire work display out of the backside of the True Form before it faded through a wall and it was not clear if it was dead.
“Fuck!”  Solide was kneeling on the ground.  H, he had his knife out as he was craving into his wrist.  F, from this angle it looked like ‘2nd/bomb/consoles’.
“What the hell are you doing?”  Kalco asked the crazed, kneeling man.
“Madigan has to live to stop the reactor from melting down, you dumb fuck!”
Solide sat there staring at the bloody tattoo he had given himself.  He traced it with his finger, repeating, “I need a second set to save him.”
“Is he okay?”  Feyria walked up to Kalco, hugging him while her pistol hung in her hand.
“I am not sure.”
He looked up at the rest of them.  “Damn it.,  I kept Zaier from being infected, and everyone here was Solarian too.,”  He pulled out his shotgun, reversed the barrel towards his head and before anyone could react, he pulled the trigger.

Ryla
Location: Reiko-10, Bunkered Room

Rox lay dead on the floor in front of Ryla, and at this point she had stopped the act of screaming.  She realized with grim satisfaction why she was here on the planet Reiko.  The act of a scared, pacifistic girl was not as much of an act as someone who knew the truth may first expect, but at this point there was no longer a purpose for it.
The Emotion Field around her was pretty saturated with the many deaths of Roxs.  At this point so many of those around her were ‘out of character’ she could only suspect this was a long, deep fracture she was stuck in.  It was subtle thing, but with the weight of the EF crushing down on Ryla these small signs might of as well have been a flare in the night.  Things like Railine’s number of his wrist that was 1573, or the quiette aside Solide gave Rox before gunning her down.
Laina was kneeling down by Rox, pronouncing her dead.  Ryla, as ‘Ryla the comm. officer’ had some medical training and thought the call was premature, but real Ryla definitely thought it was inaccurate, as Rox radiated a subtle Axl frequency that was not Solarian.  To state that another way, Ryla did not think Rox was dead at all.
Speaking of those not Solarian, that happened to be the majority of those here, depending on the technicality of Aria.  
“Ryla, are you okay?”  Railine had come up to her, placing one hand on her shoulder.  She merely nodded.  “Normally you cry or scream.”
The statement could perhaps be dismissed if not for a couple of things.  Before everything occurred and this fracture happened, Ryla had never ‘cried’ and the one or two times she ever screamed was Kalco scaring her – this implied that Railine had seen her in a fracture where she in fact did ‘cry or scream’.  All this served to further cement the theory she had going onunderstood what was happening to her.
She looked down at his hand that had light burn scars on it from some childhood accident, the number ‘73’ was the only part visible from here.  “Yeah, I guess I am in too much shock of what is happening.”
He patted her twice. , “We all are going through a lot right now.”
The Solarians were wildly successful, as far as her race was concerned - finally a success after a long list of failures.  Along with the Daijin Stars, the Axl harmonics were the best so far with the two of them.  If either knew the truth, they likely would never forgive Ryla’s race.  Unfortunate, but they were not doing this to be liked, or to be forgiven.  Forgiveness was something they were long, long past.
“I need to be alone for a while,” Ryla said, as she walked away.
“What about the monsters?”  Railine asked.
“If I see one, I’ll scream.  O, one of you will save me.”  Railine’s mouth was a straight line near a frown but said nothing else.
Walking down Gamma Wing the Emotion Field was distorted everywhere.  From various reports she had seen, what was apparent was that her race did not sense the time fractures she was in nearly as strong as Solarians.  This was evidenced by a few stories of Solarians breaking out of the fracture with near perfection of actions.  At this point, if Railine’s wrist was anywhere close to how many back fractures had occurred, Ryla ‘knew’ or ‘remembered’ almost none of them beyond vague feelings of her dying here or there.
She stopped, lifting her right hand palm up in the air.  Her eyes were closed while she concentrated on the feelings around her.  She stayed like this for many breaths, absolutely still and tranquil before opening her eyes and walking forwards.
The reason for the higher Solarian awareness was not clear;, the only explanation seemed to be their increased Axl harmonics because of the next fact that was in Ryla’s favor.  That was how clearly she could sense and read the EF around her.  The dimensional lattice might has well have been a book with the various feelings of hatred, fear, despair, surprisingly even some of love.  
When they had first come back from Reiko-7 she knew something was wrong ‘this time’ because the Field was nearly non-existent when she ‘remembered’ leaving this morning compared to returning.  It was like night and day, nothing upon taking off; at Seven7 there was a fairly strong field, then coming back here it was like walking into a wall, perhaps nearly that accurate as she did actually stumble first coming into the weapon locker room.
It immediately got her mind thinking as to why that had occurred, then with her vague premonitions of past deaths and certain acts out of the two Solarians it was enough for her to piece together what had happened.  The fracture was traveling back to somewhere right before arriving at Reiko-7.  Consciously, she would notice no difference in the ‘flow of time’ from when it was normal, to being trapped in the loop, and if at some point it ever ended.  
“The disturbing part is, I wonder how many times I’ve come to this conclusion,” she said to herself as she continued walking down the hall.
Time fractures were not unheard of.  A, a few of her race had been stuck in them before.  But short of the detailed narrative her own would leave, there was little evidence of them occurring, because from an outsider’s view time only flowed ‘once’, into whatever correct path it needed to, avoiding the fracture.
She stopped at the living quarters, going to the female section and finding Rox’s small room.  Trying the door, it was no surprise it was locked.  Ryla glanced around her, seeing no one before she took her next action.  She gripped the handle hard, and pulled it.  W, with one smooth jerk it ripped a majority of the electrical components out of the door.  It was still locked, and she punched her hand through the hole, grabbed the bolt, and pulled the entire mechanism out.  As she withdrew her hand it was bleeding only lightly despite the deep cuts the metal should have given her.
“Kind of hurts…,”  Sshe pushed the door open and dropped the mechanism on the inside of her Rox’s room while her hand rapidly healed.
The light came on, and it looked surprisingly girly, but very much like Rox.  It was not particularly up kept as the bedding was left a mess, and she had her workout shirt and shorts thrown in a corner.  There was a stuffed animal dog that was currently facedown on her dresser and a picture of her on what looked like a farm.  She was much younger but the sly grin already foretold a future of trouble making.  The caption was ‘Zuerus-4’.
Ryla picked up the picture showing her with two others and some animals in a green field.  The name sounded familiar, and then she realized Zuerus-4 was a wholly unremarkable farming colony except for the historical point that it was the first planet attacked and destroyed by the Burn.  The planet was literally destroyed, its surface sterilized.  She had to have been off-planet at the time of the attack.
‘I doubt this picture is fake, but you aren’t Solarian so why were you at that place?’ Ryla thought to herself.
Rox had a higher dimensional feel to her, perhaps a Linearian but… ‘No, that’s not right.’  Ryla shook her head.  Linearians could take whatever form they wanted, but they were type of a ‘grazer’ type species.  Funny to be so dismissive of a higher dimensional race, but they said they had achieved spiritual peace and merely wanted to ride the cosmic winds, which apparently they did whiley occasionally visiting us the lesser races.  There was a lot of discussion as to if they were really more advanced or not, leaving Ryla’s manipulative race alone.  As one further point, Linearians were the only race that knew about Ryla’s, though they were probably the only ones that knew about them likewise.
That didn’t fit Rox’s story though.  B, being present at two major events was not coincidental.  
Ryla walked towards a dresserd and felt a different, warm energy.  ‘Whoa…what do we have here?’  Sshe opened up the first two drawers, saw nothing beyond some clothes, trinkets, and some hair accessories.  The third one though, froze her.
The sky blue was instantly familiar but she tried to sideline that fact as just coincidence.  The texture as she rapidly grabbed it in shock was far too accurate,; the long, thin nature of what she was holding was uncanny.  She pulled it out of the drawer, and felt it softly vibrating on a level a pure-physical creature would never understand.
“Why…why do they have our scarves here?”   She took a step back, holding onto it, not wanting to let go for the strong nostalgia she was being consumed by, but likewise shocked by what apparently was nothing more than a well-made light blue scarf .
Ryla glanced around, finding a knife and needed wanting to test beyond a doubt.  She stabbed the scarf, which repelled the knife.  She turned and b, barely pressed the knifeing into the desk, the knife vibrating easilyed through the material.  B, but when tried against the scarf it again was repulsed.  She dropped the knife, letting it tink of to the floor as Ryla fell to her knees crying as she held the soft cloth to her face.
It had been so long since she had been home, so much had happened.  She felt guilty for some of the things she had done, all in the name of appearing as a highly competent but dark past girl of Ryla, only to go through her different intel tasks which currently had her here for this nightmare.  
She had missed it all so much.  The long ring world of her home, the beauty of the world fact that at any point on the planet,as anywhere one could look up and see the planet slowly stretching upwards away from them; the subtle, gorgeous Emotion Field that radiated this peaceful, energizing aura; the strong harmonics that her long gone harmonic plates would resonate with, filling her with energy.
She cried for a long time, desperately wanting to be home so badly.  A practical pride slowly returned to her, and realized Zeo was personally counting on her, as well as her whole race for her to be strong.  She stood up, wrapping the scarf around her neck and continued looking in the drawer.  There were two other things that interested her that Rox had come to possess.
First was a bracelet, well, her race’s bracelet to say it accurately.  It was a dark black with bright sky blue triangles on the top of it.  It was a simple design, stylish without being gaudy.  The bracelet however was similar to shields or force bracers used by many races except far more strong.  These were the type given to elite units going into battle and would provide life-saving protection.  She put this on as well, and with a touch on the bracelet and along with a thought it was tuned to her field.  Not that Ryla anticipated combat – , though with these two things on she was far more equipped than heavy battle armor, – but more so like a little girl wanting to play dress up with clothes she had not seen in such a long time.
The last thing, was the item that she felt its aura from.  Why Rox had this was deeply disturbing, as she clearly understood it’s power, along with having it next to two items from her race that were somehow here.
At a quick glance it looked like a type of shotgun.  I, it had all conventional features such as the buttstock, trigger, the main firing and power mechanism, the wide bore and even a lower part to pump or rack whatever it actually fired.  Someone looking at it would think it was an interesting custom shotgun with its silver and black paintjob.  It looked sleek and powerful, and Ryla was not big into weapons.  She reached forward to touch it to confirm and felt the warmness turn into a subtle burning.  
The pain was something she could endure if she had to, but there was no point.  She knew was it was.
A voice  from the door surprised her, as her Psionics should have felt someone coming.  “You know, you could have just asked me to get in.”  Rox was standing there, a hand on her hip and a large silly grin on her face.
“You were dead,”  Ryla said, showing good poise.  She was less surprised than one might have been because due toof her conclusion that Rox was likely an upper dimensional being of some kind already.
“Aww…it’s no fun being dead.  You didn’t really think I was, did you?”
“No.”  Ryla turned away from Rox, feeling neither shame for being caught snooping, nor scared about Rox’s resurrection.  “How are you still alive?”
“I think you know.”
Ryla said coldly, “I have a few guesses.”
Rox laughed,.  “I hate that tone, this is supposed to be fun.  So…those clothes look good on you girl~!”
“…Thank you.”  Ryla blushed for a moment, spared more only by the sincerity Rox spoke with.  Ryla pointed to the weapon;, given its form it had been Binded to someone in the past and likely was ownerless right now.  “Why do you have a CAO here?”
“ A ‘Cow’?  Like a moo-moo type ?”  Rox wore an exaggerated confused looked on her face, her one lifted eyebrow nearly touching the beads on the side of her hair.
“Sorry…Condensed Axl Object, something composed of pure life energy.  This one has taken the form of a weapon, suggesting it had a previous owner it was Binded to that was predisposed to violence as their primary method of affecting reality.”
“I know, I was just kidding!”
“What?”  Ryla asked.
“I know what it is, and what you call them, but it’s such a droll name.  Why not call it something exciting like a ‘Lifeforce Wwill aAmalgam aAmplifier’?”
Ryla frowned,.  “I am not sure that even makes sense.”
“They are dangerous to you, I say that with earnestness,”  Rox had walked over, picking up the weapon.
Ryla looked at the door,.  “Are we safe to talk here?”
“Sure, other than my door handle being ripped out, it doesn’t look that bad.  No one is likely to come down this way.  N, no Chrono Lines have that happening.”
Ryla watched as Rox was holding the weapon very softly, both palms up and open.
Rox talked about something else nowwent back to the prior topic. , “Not all of them are destructive like this.  This was merely the way its owner thought to best influence reality.  Did you know weapons are a subconsciously preferred format in something like three out of four Bindings?”
Ryla had shifted her scarf slightly.  ‘Her’ scarf;, she laughed at how fast she took ownership of it.  “I didn’t know it was ever not weapons, considering what they often do.”
Rox sat it down back in the drawer, laughing sadly.  “How like your race.  You espouse so many higher concepts and truths, but in the end always resorted to violence.”
“ ‘My race’?  How do you know?”
Rox giggled,.  “Let’s not talk falsely now, the time is getting late.  I knew what you were the very first time I ever saw you.  Y, you guys have a very distinct but positive Axl wave; and it’s not an accident you are wearing those, oh uh… ‘my’ clothes.”
“Sorry, I thought they were cute.  I should take them off.”
Rox smiled. , “Nah, you leave ‘em on, girl.  But...you did know how to tune the bracelet.”
Ryla froze, her own vagueness and acting subtly coy was not beyond Rox.  “Sorry, I won’t be stupid.  It is now clear to me I am dealing with someone…”  sShe was at a loss of words,; how did she describe what Rox was?
“Really cute?”
“Yeah,” Ryla laughed for once, “lLet’s go with that.”
Rox was petting the shotgun right now,.  “You know, you can use these but it will kill you.  Well, I don’t mean this one, it’s frequency is too different for you.  But you know what I mean!”
“Yeah, they will kill almost anything…in both senses,” Ryla said with a touch of moroseness.  “We know that first hand.”
“Only a fraction of the people here can use the CAOs…ugh that name is so gross.  H how about something fun like I said before, but a cool acronym, like LAW – Lifeforce Amplifier for Will.”
Ryla did not say anything;, the options of what Rox might be led to Ryla’s prudence.
“What do you mean only a few?”
“You should know, after all given what your race has done to the poor Solarians and the Daijin Stars.”
Ryla did not feel threatened by that, but the fact Rox knew of that left very little options of what she was left.
“I understand that, but Solarians have high Axl affinity.”
Rox wagged her finger. , “As a generality.  Only a small fraction can use them.  Well, innately anyway.  A, a larger fraction can eventually become synched with one.  But let’s see, one, two…”  Sshe started counting something Ryla didn’t know.  “Three and a half !” s She exclaimed proudly.
“What?!”  Ryla had no idea what she was talking about.
“Is that surprising to you?  There are two Solarians here with really good harmonic waves, and three of you that could technically use them.”
“Aren’t most here Solarian?”
The tough woman nodded. , “Of course, but for every person that can use a LAW, way more can’t, or they harmonize with MalAxls, or anything along those lines.  All these twisted forms around us were Solarians that were corrupted by MalAxls, it is very sad.”  Despite Rox’s over the top behavior, the ‘sad’ part of her statement seemed imbued with sincerity.  “By the way, did I ever tell you how absolutely cute your ribbon is?”
“Uh…thank you.  I assume you know who the three and a half are?”
“I do, but I can’t tell you.  That isn’t me being coy either, something you might not understand.”  She stopped, looklookinged back at Ryla. , “Seriously!  You are such a cute little girl…or pretend to be anyway!”
Ryla was not side tracked. , “I assume you aren’t counting you or myself in your count.”
“Not me, I can’t use them because of the Fate magnitude breach.  You are a half .  Both because you can technically use them, but will usually die, but there are a few LAWs,” she said her term in a deep voice that bordered on comical, “that have a very similar vibrational energy, suggesting to me you could probably use it with the typical effects.”
…The typical effects.  Ryla knew all too well what that meant, how even a slight mis-match on the harmonics for her race meant death, and a match still meant a vastly shortened life.
Rox had taken a step away.  S, she was facing the door, her back to Ryla as she began speaking of something very deep.  “What your race did was very brave.  I know everyone would hate you for it, but you had no choice.  Not that that is an excuse, but it had to be done.  The MalAxls were far too powerful at that point and everything needed to be reset, even if the cost was so high.  Words can’t express the pain you caused, nor make up for it, but kneow it was the right decision.”
Ryla had turned away from her too, her eyes were closed and tears were slowly flowing out of them.  “I was not there, not even close.  But I do trace my lineage to two of what you could call fathers who were part of what you are talking about.  Their bravery, strength, poise, and duty fill me with such pride and emotion.  They were so much stronger than I could ever hope to be, but I also use them as a source of strength to never give up.”
At this point Rox had come over, and was hugging Ryla,.  Ryla leaned into the larger womaen and sobbed.  The scene that was occurring was so far beyond two ‘women’ sitting in a room talking and crying, because of the fact things were being discussed that were almost utterly unknown.
“God …”  Ryla sobbed,.  “Sso many sacrifices because ‘we had it’, ‘I had to’, ‘it had to be done’…” Ryla’s voice broke and she started crying hard, falling to her knees.  Rox knelt down with her, holding the young girl’s head to her breasts, stroking her head gently.
“I killed two people once,” Ryla muttered out.  “It was out of ‘jealousy’, as ‘Ryla’ had not done a proper job communicating between two parties.  It looked so sad and preventable, my best friend and my boyfriend, killed on that rainy night.  It was set up to be so deniable that few would know it, but others would see my skills and know I needed a redemption assignment like that.   This Fate Line…”  Sshe sobbed,.  “The Fate Lines had to be that way.  Both of them also were going to end up as negative elements in the future and that is why…that’s why…”
“It’ is okay.”  Rox patted the young girl.  Though Rox knew age was a distortion, and it was likely Ryla might be older than when Rox appeared in existence.  “They are part of the Line now.”
“We just can’t always justify killing because they return to the Line…What if those two chose a different Fate?  It was not locked in, it was only likely.”
“That was the decision you made.  T, time doesn’t flow backwards short of fractures and now all you can do is learn.  I understand the intense love/hate relationship you guys have with your power but also you’re your devotion to the Line.  I sympathize with how hard it must be to be so aware of the damage you cause, but also know you alone are the ones who often must do it.  Sad .”  Rox had tears in her eyes too for sympathy of the emotional plight Ryla endured on a level no one else would understand.
Ryla sat back, both of the women were still kneeling.  Ryla wiped her eyes. , “It appears we are stuck in a time fracture.  I, is it because the MACs win?”
“Old MAC-donald had a farm…”  Ryla looked confused.  “Sorry!  I crack myself up sometimes .”  She got serious. , “Believe it or not, I do not know.  The universe—, oh I guess I should call it Illuna when I am by you…anyway Illuna has not shown a preference for causing these things simply because of localized MalAxl victories.”
Ryla took a deep breath, remembering her two ancient ‘fathers’ that died doing it. , “That is why we had to make such a sacrifice for Illuna…”
Rox nodded solemnly. , “Indeed.  Not to say it may not happen, but they typically occur when reality itself fragments, which MalAxls do not do, so much as rewrite it in a different image.”
Suddenly tAt the door it was bashed open as one of the –, as Ryla’s race would call them –, a Lesser Evolved Creatures had found them.  It moved fast and Ryla’s Psionics were focused once again instead of remembering the sins of her race and she jumped back, clearing it easily without even needing the bracelet to block.
“I hate being interrupted,” Rox said.  S, she lifted her hand and the creature exploded in a dazzling confetti of blue sparkles that rapidly disappeared.
Ryla’s mouth was open. , “…how…?”
“It didn’t eaffect the Fate Line.  This one ends, which gives me far more power than typical, plus that thing never actually hurts or kills you.  T, the other path was that you dodge long enough that Solide hears it, then comes and kills it.  No net change.”
“I don’t get what you are saying.”
The tomboyish woman shrugged,.  “You don’t have to.  Rules we are bound by, is all.”
“How do you know all this?”
“I’m what you would probably call a god.”
“Oh…” Ryla simply said, but her world was hit very hard by the simple string.
“Aww, come on, don’t be shy.  We are all made of the same Axls, I just have more.  Kind of a purer essence of reality, if I do say so myself!”
Ryla still stood there in shock.  They of course knew of LineGods, and there were even a few that took place in the original battle that was lost; it was before the backup plan of the great wipe had to be enacted, but to potentially see one in front of her…
Rox closed her eyes,.  “Anyway it seems the other forces are trying something new this time, and this Line is almost over.  The apparent reason this is occurring is the fusion reactor melts down, destroying the planet.  No one lives to see the future here obviously,.”  Rox laughed inappropriately at the dark future,.  “Sso I can’t say if some reality-destroying particle is created and that’s why it fractures – that’s the typical case by the way – o.  Or, and this is pure guess even for me, Illuna needs something to occur here that, at some far away future, has to happen.  So, it may be like far, far in the future that some little effect didn’t occur which at that point destroys Illuna and causes the back fracture all the way to our sad party right here.”
Ryla spoke with wonder, “Some sort of hyper pre-destination, or entanglement.”
The beads in Rox’s hair bounced with her head movement. , “Right.”
“Well, how do we get out?”
“We do whatever it is Illuna needs requires in order to survive at some indistinct point in the future.”
“I certainly don’t know what that is.  Do you?”
“Nope.”
Ryla’s face betrayed her surprise.  “Uh…you don’t?”
“Nope!  But if I had to guess, given that it fractures right at arriving at Reiko-7, with only ten of us left, I would guess perhaps you all have to survive.  No single person is enough, which is interesting in its own way.”
“Well, then we just figure out how to do that!”  Ryla said, poised for what had to be done.
“Join the club .”
“Fine I will!”  Ryla said with a deep sense of pride.  “I will go tell everyone right now.”
“This Chrono Line resets soon.  T, the reactor got sabotaged, Zaier and Laina are already infected and…looks like Madigan and—…”  oOn queue cue there was a burst of gunfire far down the hall. , “…aand Aria is dead too.”
“No…”
Rox lifted her palm up.,  “Understand that this isn’t easy.  The sacrifice you may have to make could be high.”
“Is it scary when I die?”
Rox didn’t know.,  “Do you remember the other thousand ?”
Ryla was defiant. , “My race hbas borne every burden, I will not waver in what needs to be done.”
“Indeed.  You guys never have.”

Solide
Location: Solide’s Room, Living Quarters

Solide realized he was chained to Fate.  Initially, when he was just a regular soldier, he was dismissive of a bunch of that magic bullshit about gods, angels, life after death, religion or any spirituality.  Of course he served the Aelisha and was indoctrinated hard in their system but he was too skeptical for it to really take hold.  Blowing enemies away for the Solarians acting as a proxy to the Aelisha hammered out any delusion pretty fast.  There were plenty of ‘it’s Fate’s decree’ types that got killed just as randomly where the most hedonistic would haplessly turn one way or another and escape a kill shot.  Perhaps it was one too many Priestesses endless blabbering on about Fate and the Line while he was racking up kills for them that started to get to him.
What he was living gave him an entirely new perspective of Fate and what that word meant; perhaps with the bitterest of redemptions admitted those bitches might have been right.  He slowly realized he was incapable of understanding the upper workings of reality playing out around him, and the multitude of dimensionalities he had encountered left him with little doubt of truly being able to understand it.  
The largest realization he had was the thought that ‘God’ was a concept that was laughable in the simplicity many espoused of it.  In some ways Fate could be argued as God, but it was mostly speculation from him on the bottom; it was more pointless and laughable than an single insect like an ant pondering on the merits of Solarian military and colonization strategy .
Talking to Rox helped little as well, as it was quite clear they perceived things differently.  From her flighty words pieced together over the multitude of back fractures he learned of an approximate  pyramid structure to the upper levels of reality.  He, as a Solarian, was near the bottom.  This accounted for approximately half of the ten survivors on Reiko-10.  Above them on the physical realm were the Aelisha who were far more genetically honed with higher nanite quality, so even an elite Solarian like Solide was barely comparable to an average Aelisha.  Then you had whatever Ryla was,; she was a ‘base’ being like nearly everyone else here was with the exception of infected-Laina, infected-Zaier and Rox, but left even the Aelisha behind in whatever technology and evolution was behind her.  He had been killed by her a few times, and had only killed her twice when he had an Axl weapon.
Among much of ‘physical’ subset of reality, Aelisha were pretty high but surprisingly not the highest.  It was not the Burn, or the Daijins, either as might be thought.  Of course aliens like Behemon were far away stronger than an Aelisha, but in a general all-around prowess and intellect.  Rox was really vague about it, but apparently Aelisha were not the highest,.  Solide did everything he could but she insisted that while she knew, she couldn’t tell him because it violated the will effect she was constrained by, something about Fate magnitude or some bullshit.  Regardless, this upper being was what Ryla likely was.
He was hard-headed among other things, and a few cycles decided he was going to threaten, torture and straight up kill her a few times as it became so incredibly personal to find who was ahead of his masters, the Aelisha.  Blowing her away after about the tenth time he realized she was actually telling the truth that it wasn’t that she did not want to tell him – she couldn’t.
He felt really bad about it, and one time she decided she didn’t actually want to die and murdered him out.  A, and another time she let him pump an incredible amount of shells into her and before she laughed it off before disappearingand disappeared, and letting him die when the base burned down a few cycles later.  In general though she was surprisingly forgiving and simply said, ‘it is in your nature, I don’t blame you.’
To explain, as he slowly pieced it together, she couldn’t tell him because it was knowledge that was too powerful for him to know.  Not that it was some reality-fabric-tearing secret, but that politically it was too potent and his mere knowledge of it caused rifts she was not able to create.  At this point Solide still had no fucking clue what she was talking about.
Essentially though, to simplify it as much as she could - and he eventually could - there was an approximate balance between will/acting potential, and knowledge of just about anything really.  Solide was, at least, conventionally street smart, after all he was a copter pilot as well as a Classed Soldier.  S, so he felt like he had a good grasp of things, but it was at the edge of his understanding.  So ‘beings’ like Rox could see and understand the future in ways Solide was completely blind to; in contrast Solide, in what he understood, was near complete ignorance and could act in complete freedom without consequence of his actions.
That last part was the key, and the answer to why Rox could not tell Solide certain things as much as she ‘wanted’ too.  On the physical level wants, desires, actions can be pursued freely, as they were not bound by the flow of time, or any opening/closing of Fate Lines.  He could act completely recklessly at whatever cost to the Fate Lines because on theirre base level, they were an ultimately rooted base reality – of which he was almost entirely constructed out of.
To state it in a more bloody example as he found out, he could kill everyone here, and that would quite decisively end the Fate Lines for all of them, him included, in a few cycles.  Rox could see and predict what would happen in general with each cut of a Line, but could do very, very little to change any of it.
This also was important to note he could act with abandon, but without the appropriate Lines, there was nothing to be done.  The power was in forcing Lines, or changing them.  The ‘preset’ Fates so to say, there were not an infinite options at all, but very limited.
‘Holy shit, that’s why normally I could never actually kill you, but in so many cycles I killed you in what appeared “normal” fashion because any revelation of being alive and your higher reality changed  the Fate Lines!’ She nodded excitedly some thousand cycles ago when he realized that.
Also, he asked her a few times about how or why she was able to kill him.  Wasn’t killing him, an act of will, thereby negating her supsposed rules he asked about before?.  The answer apparently was that because this Line was ending on the loop, her actions did not affect the future.  It was a very fine line, no pun intended, that she could end Solide to make him wake up on the next loop faster, but that showing anyone else she was a demigod  could not be done, lest someone remember beyond that specific line.
He sighed right now, trying to think of everything he was slowly piecing together.  Rox rubbed his naked abdominal muscles, moaning contentedly.  
“Hey,” he said roughly, “I just thought of something.”
“That’s a near first!”
“You couldn’t show anyone your truth, but Railine knows, right?  Why was he excluded?”
“Eventually he came to figure it out on his own.  That is the distinction.  ‘I’ didn’t show it, he found  himselfit himself.  It’s eEntirely possible others here could find out as well, but it’s unlikely to stick with them through the back fracture, but I have no way of knowing that.”
“So, are you like actually bound, or just ‘better not do that shit’ kind of bound?”
“Hmm?”  Her eyes looked doe-like at him, dragging her finger up and down his body.
“Are your lack of actions, actually blocked to you, or do you consciously block them to be safe?  Is it that you just can’t take a chance, or is there a force stopping you?”  A lifetime ago or two he was not the curious or intellectual type, but the events he had been forced into changed that.  At this point it had become an interest to him where at first it was merely survival of ‘how the fuck do I get out of this?’
“Fate stops me.  No choice.”
“So…you’ve never talked to others before?”  he asked.
“Oh, I have.  I have had pretty good conversations with both Ryla and Zaier before.”
He had his hand on her leg, massaging her thick, strong thigh.  “I don’t get it at all.  D, doesn’t that violate whatever Fate thing you are bound by?”
“No.  I oOnly talked with Zaier when he has already converted, so there was no way he can could remember.  Ryla loosely realizes it is a time fracture, but perceives it through the Emotion Field, so it’s not the same.”
A major other issue here was of course Axls, and Line Artifacts that Reiko-10 had in an abnormal number.  Reiko was not abnormal in that regard, as many other planets had natural or implanted Line Artifacts, but it was the fact that it was also where the upper reality lattices connected – essentially a gate of sorts.  Which then lead to the ability of the True Forms to make their constant appearance.
“You think too much.,”  Rox drug a sensual finger down his chest.  H, he looked over at her, then back up at the ceiling, hearing the wind howl outside.
“You forget that I don’t…or literally can’t remember everything I know or learn each time.  Some of it I remember through who knows what, and the other major part of it I have to pick up from the Emotional Field and however it slowly accumulates in here,” he said tapping his head with his left finger.
Axls composed everything, but too high would be dangerous, and actually being near Rox was killing him.  But he died so fast, so often, these resets made that reality a bit moot for now.  Regardless, Solarians had a much higher capacity, which and had many advantages as well as disadvantages.  But, what it largely meant here, on this planet ‘right now’, was that they represented items that could be very useful to them – at a cost of life length.
For some of the ten here, they could never use it, as they literally lacked the Axl Affinity to do so.  Apparently it was loosely correlated with the ability to become aware of these time loops, but not necessarily.  Further, if they had MalAxl affinities in any way they could not use the Axl weapons.  That meant the Zaier, Laina, and Feyria could not.  In a bunch of separate loops he saw Feyria get hit and ‘infected’ - infected was such an inaccurate word but he didn’t have anything better – and instead of dying like nearly everyone else here did, she eventually distorted into the pathetic twisted creatures that roamed Reiko.  That explained where they all came from, and where the rest of the people on the base had gone: dead or twisted.
It took a few hits, or a very serious one to allow the infection to truly take over.  It was not a one and done.  It appeared there was some threshold that had to be passed.  Railine for example had taken many hits in a few loops, eventually dying not from a bleed out, but a literal lack of life force.  Solide had seen that before, mostly with old people but not always, where they ‘should’ still be alive as nothing was wrong, but they were just out of here, and now he understood why.  Lack of Life.
Laina and Zaier apparently were like Solide but a mirror image or reverse in that his affinity for Axls were their affinity for MalAxls, but much higher than Feyria, which was their ‘True Form’.
What was equally puzzling though, was the rest of them, and their ability or inability to use the Axl artifacts.  Strangely, it was him and Railine, – he knew his name now after so many loops –, that apparently had the highest and were able to use nearly any of the items instantly and didn’t kill themselves, as their Axl’s disassociated as they did with others.  
Well, they could not use them initially anyway, as it appeared there had to be at least an ‘awareness’ of the potential to change reality to allow it to occur.  Essentially, it was a knowledge on a deeper level, something that survived the back fractures that was accumulating and allowed greater ease of the Axl objects to be used.
‘You Awaken to the truth!’ Rox said once.
Awaken was apparently what needed to happy.  But what still confused him, was wondering if did others simply dide not awaken, or were they unable to, or was that only a part of what was necessary?
The awakening –, shit, he supposed  I guess he should capitalize that thing, as Rox always told him… “Awakening” – , Awakening often meant undergoing some sort of vast personal trial and letting various things in their your heart or mind go.  Awakening in one loop did not mean anything.
Regardless, a few times he saw Kalco actually use one of thosea weapons, and they fired alright.  I, it killed the True Form instantly, but in a matter of moments Kalco aged so rapidly his body melted down in something similar to an N-Limit;, it was deeply disturbing.  That hung in Solide’s mind for a long time every time he used a weapon after that.  Aria could use them, occasionally, and didn’t die; he was not sure what was the deal was with her, but something wasn’t right.
Let’s see, never seen Ryla use them.  She had to have known something though.  T, the fact she didn’t use them suggested she might know they’d kill her, all of course playing into her alien theory her  and Railine had about her.
Last was Madigan, a Solarian through and through, but in no loop was he ever able to use them.  He had survived the aliens ruins and gained a deep awareness, had overcome his fear of women, all sorts of things, and it just never worked.  ‘Infected’ enough by MalAxls he would simply die, just like Solide and Railine except had no benefit.  Supposedly all Solarians ‘eventually’ could use them, but he must be on the bottom of the barrel, low Axl affinity, or not capable of perceiving higher realities, whatever the case.  It wasn’t looking good for him at this point.
Rox was poking him. , “Do you realize you and your friend Railine know more than almost anyone in your race about things like this?”
“Ironic that someone like me knows.”
She laughed. , “Don’t flatter yourself, it was mostly circumstantial.”  She balled her fist up and lightly hit him on the chest a few times.  “You had an awareness certainly, but you just happened to be in a bad reset.”
“Hey, is my therapist supposed to be hitting me?”
She giggled. , “You think I am joking about that.  You’d have gone crazy.  You are lucky we met relatively fast.  Sometimes they truly break down for a long, long time.  T, the universe isn’t a friendly place and no one is there to pick them up.  After a thousand times of killing themselves even nihilism is eventually killed.”
He grabbed her fist, and pulled her into him, grabbing her and putting her on top of him as they lay there.  “Stop talking.  I don’t like your attitude right now.”
“Maybe your should punish me~?”
He smiled. , “Ddoes this break your rules if you know what happens, but I am the one who does the action?”
She shook her head rapidly no, with a big smile on.
In one smooth move, he flipped her over, and was pinning her arms by her head.  The beads in her head hung off to one side, as her naked body was slowly breatheding faster and faster.  “You are lucky I like you,” he said to her.
“You didn’t at first.”
“No, you were a traitorous bitch for at least the first thousand times, trying to sneak some weapon back to our base.”  Uusing one hand to hold the two of hers, he bent down kissing her.  She started kissing him back with a certain harshness to her, almost biting him with her energy.
“That CAO was for you, or anyone really.”
“Yeah, anyone who wakes up to our true reality, and is of sufficient Axl Affinity.  Otherwise they would die instantly like what happened to Kalco.  Or if wrong Axl leaning could turn into a True Form, the equivalent but mirror I suppose .”
Rox’s legs were squirming in impatience under Solide.  Of course she could break his one-hand grasp but it was more of the feel of being controlled that was enjoyed in this moment.
“You know,” she turned away from him, feigning sadness, “you never said thanks for the gift.”
“You just told me it was for anyone.,”
“It was for you!”
“Yeah right.,”  Hhe grasped her mouth, going for the kiss, but then pusheding it to the side, and kissing her check instead.  
“It does!  They change forms, why do you think it looks like a shotgun?”
“Bad girl, opening your mouth.,”  Hhe bent down, holding her mouth closed as he kissed her eyes.  “Though…,”  Hhe let her go, and sat up, reaching over to the weapon.  ‘Hrunting’ was it’s name.  U, unlike ‘Claim Jumper’ which he named himitself, it came with its own name that he understood holding it.  “I am all dressed up, and no place to go.”
He grasped the handle, and the weapon respondeding to a deeper dimensional will Solide now possessed.  I it responded as it spun to life, pieces clickinged and expanding into place.  Multiple pieces slid out, locking into place as others clicked downwards and backwards creating a butt stock should he choose to fire it as such.  There was a slow backwards pulse of five lights that ran down both sides of the barrel. It had become a sleek black/gray gun with a huge bore.
Smiling, he pulled the trigger.  F, five black dots fired out at a rate far faster than could be processed, and what was seen was only the after-image.  The black balls were enveloped in a red energy and tail, and each entire orb as it exited the barrel grew to about thea size of a little less than a fist as they flew away in a tight choke.  They hit the wall and made zero sound beyond a ‘THONG’ type sound from the actual weapon firing.  The wall dematerialized as the projectiles spread out into the outside, unlikely to be stopped for quite a while.  With one quick press, he changed the mode to a much wider, numerous spread and fired again with a flurry of small packets that grated the wall.  The weapon had zero recoil and was a wonder to behold in its destruction.  
He laughed and dropped it to the floor.
“You know that destruction is why those like Laina have a point to their cause,” Rox chided him.  
“I am surprised you are even capable of sympathy with your enemy.”
She hugged herself. , “Now it’s all cold in here due to your behavior.”
“We better warm up a little then.,”  He grabbed her, maneuvering her down and backwards so her backside was now facing him.  “Despite me about to enjoy what I am going to do to you,” he said grasping a clump of hair in his hand, “I can’t help but think you did what you could to bring me here.”
“In more ways than your might imagine…”

Railine
Location: Living Quarters

‘Should the whole frame of nature around him break,’ Railine thought to himself as he was kneeling, taking a breath between each part of the poem he was reciting in his mind as part of a meditation to retain his sanity, ‘in ruin and confusion hurled, he unconcerned would hear the mighty crack and stand secure amidst a falling world’. He paused, taking a few more breaths before standing up.
Free will determinism.  Yes, that was an appropriate name for what reality appeared to be to Railine and his endless loops.  He stared down as he completed the final markings on his arm, numbering 2991, likely at least a thousand or more completely forgotten or not ‘remembered enough’ to file away, this number took a long time and the association of it was his nearly perfect test score of 997 for Damage Control, tripled.
He likely would have to skip to 3000 next as there was no ‘memorable’ tie to the numbers 2991-2999.  As such would have to be convinced he had lived 2991 at least nine times, but he was sure that condition had been fulfilled already.
Doing a quick run through, he had a backup knife on his ankle, two separate pills, a small pistol, and a set of explosives.  That covered most situations where he would have to kill himself.
Being a bit stubborn on that issue, he initially refused to kill himself, a large part due to not believing what was happening.  But after a few too many times of being seriously wounded, hanging on for planet cycles, each moment torture, this was the better way.  Solide came to a similar conclusion; situation, he had found him dead by his own hand a few times.  The loop didn’t end when either of them died, so he would look at the body of a man physically stronger than him, wonder what he had thought in his final moments, and continued on.
He closed his eyes, feeling this energy around him that held the fears, hopes, thoughts, and reactions of thousands of Railines before him that had died – mostly due to True Forms.  That statement was perhaps strange as it was not a ‘different’ Railine, it was him after all.  No different than the person someone was yesterday, it was ‘them’ but in some way there was something vital missing from the lack of the animating element of ‘nowness’.  
“I have free will,” he said to himself as he looked at his right hand, moving the fingers according to his desires.  Being born to a woman biologically, he was naturally right-handed like most arewere, which put him in the minority of the crew around him.  “I can do in general what I prefer.”  He swung his hand around in arcs.
‘Yet,’ he thought, ‘some Fates are inescapable.’  He started capitalizing the word ‘Fate’ as it had taken on a mystical level that even he was not expecting.  He was aware of Psionics of course, and did not know how they fit into the picture he was slowly coming to understand.  The Chrono branch anyway is where his confusion came from, as if this was a version, or perhaps how the branch of those Psionics worked..  He wasn’t sure he had any Psionics at all, beyond some in very low levels that most Solarians had.
The ‘determinism’ came from his own study of Psionics, which he devoted many cycles to thinking that perhaps that was what he was experiencing.  He knew some of the basics, but had a healthy respect to stay away from those types that espoused Chrono abilities.  I, it was unnerving little slips that came to fruition.  The large thing now was the way adapts  in this branch described the way they perceived reality was what he was finding himself from running into ‘Fate Walls’  of things he simply could not change.  From what he was aware of, there were large, gross options of free will choices that essentially were limited -– the determinism aspect of reality.
Railine did not have a closed heart, but his introversion and stoic nature were not readily conducive to having a lot of female relationships.  There was one in his adolescence that he was really close with that ended up getting picked up by Solarian military intelligence, but she had a Chrono Psionic that he somewhat regretted not probing her more for about at the time.  The only reason he remembered her now –, not that they ended on anything close to bad terms, – was the way she described her visions seemed an awful lotawfully like what he was stumbling into.  
‘How did you know that was going to happen?’  He was breathing hard back then,; her hand had pulled back his shoulder, stopping him enough that right in front of himto dodge the large boulder that, if not outright killing him, certainly would have maimed him had he continued forward that one step.  Alone in the mountains, the land slide easily would have wrecked youth-Railine.  The near miss shocked him and they jumped and ran backwards a bit to escape to small landslide that in the end did not amount to much, but was enough to end a fragile Solarian if he had been hit with any of the body- sized rocks.
She giggled a bit, pulling the much larger adolescent into her soft frame as they embraced.  ‘I wanted to protect you.’
‘But how did you know?’ 
She pulled herself away, still holding him with both her hands, smiling with their youthful love for the other.  ‘I see the alternatives.  I didn’t see it until then, but the choice was to protect you, or to let you die.  Certain times they just hit me, the real choices we have.’
He was still huffing from the random near miss during their hike in the high mountains of Lania Prime, looking to his left where the rock had fallen far below, smashing some trees apart.  ‘Real choices?’
‘Of course!  We think we are free, but we only have a few real choices.’  Below them a boulder shifted, breaking a tree.  ‘I didn’t have a choice to save you until then.’
He swallowed, letting the moment go of just a close call that his girl friend somehow knew to save him from.  They had backed away from the narrow chute the landslide occurred at, he was sitting down as he tried to control, controlling his breathing.  ‘I don’t follow at all.  I can choose whatever I want.’
She giggled more,.  ‘That’s what I thought when I was young.  It’s similar to being in a room.  W, we can move around, but ultimately when its time to leave we have to go out through a door.  There’s only a few.’
‘What if I don’t want to go through a door?’
‘Eventually you are forced.  I simply see the doors sometimes, but it sounds like you don’t.  Often times I don’t.  Rarely does what we do matter, except at critical junctures, then choices exist.’”
‘Why did the choice even exist then?’ he had   He asked, completely serious despite her being whimsical.
‘I guess there is some choice somewhere when it matters that you are alive, because you have important things you will accomplish in your life!’”  She leaned forward and kissed him.  He mechanically responded as the moment escalated to a time he would remember his whole life; but it was tainted because his mind couldn’t let go on the implication of her words at the time.
Some choice somewhere when it matters that you are alive.
Something hung very heavy over his mind, and it was the question if his interaction and connection he held with his friend so long ago was for a purpose.  As unconventional as his mind was, vanity was not asn aspect of it.  His ‘specialness’ was non-existent.  The issue arose of course, that a girl he dismissed as he got older as unique and glad he knew her, to somehow her interpretation of existence was something being forced into Railine’s mind through an apparent time loop or some sort of conscience transference.
Railine heard some gunfire a room over;, it was likely Solide killing Rox.  This happened in a majority of the times Railine could feel from the effect of ‘déjà vu’ of these loops he was in.  He’d tried stopping it a few times, but most times it seemed to simply accelerate everyone else dying and Railine was attempting to maximize his time and learning if only because he was not sure these loops would last forever.
There was were a lot of options that could be taken at that point, and this is where his young girl friend at the time was so precocious.  Railine knew far less about Psionics than he really should have, especially given his philosophic bent, but looking back her young mind used many of the accepted Chrono terms such as her use of ‘junctures’ for Junctions, and the room/door analogy which he had read somewhere else before.  
What literally was happening to Railine through these endless deaths and resets was his blindness was being open to the ‘room’ he was in by simply getting bashed into the room and doors over and over until he found out what it was approximately structured like.  Then that was one room.  Each door lead to a different room, structured different.  The problems became obvious very quickly, as the memories of the past were not complete, were not perfect, and many were outright lost and forgotten.  Was it Madigan that needed to witness Rox dying to know the truth about Solide so he would stick around to save the Fusion Reactor, or was it Ryla who had to see it and still decide to go with Solide to survive the next night when Laina would kill Ryla?
He had tried writing all these things down, staring at them, but it helped only a little.  
This is what Railine’s old friend likely meant with the limited choices.  At this very point Railine had only a few major choices.  He could have been out there with dead Rox, and confronted, yelled, attacked or any various ‘choices’ aimed against Solide, but they all led to the same general outcome of an escalating fight that left even more people dead and often would rapidly trigger the reset.  To be clear, these all were a gamut of actions/choices Railine could make but all fundamentally were the same: escalate conflict with Solide.  That lead down the rapidly terminating line.  Thus his term of ‘Free will determinism’, as anything Railine chose to do, fundamentally did not change the outcome – as it was already determined as some previous junction.
He paused a moment, quite impressed with the ‘structure’ of this new world he found himself in.  Bumbling and blind, but was slowly piecing it together.  Puzzling He puzzled over the unchangeable paths, and often the littlest of things at some prior point is how a path would get re-routed.  Much like as a youthwhen long ago the act of his girlfriend simply grabbing his shoulder to delayed him a moment to spare him from a crushing death.
The next path he blindlyed stumbled upon was to offer little resistance to Solide murdering Rox and then attempt to save Rox.  T, that path often lasted a long time but would terminate in a few different outcomes/‘rooms’.  Outcomes like Laina’s infection fully manifesting and wiping everyone out, or Ryla often dying first followed by the others.  Interestingly he had made a few attempts of over-powering Laina and saving Rox right at the start.  The surprise was that Rox was not dead – a disturbing thing to realize one time when she shot her eyes open despite missing half her head and started laughing at them.  ‘You are figuring this out almost as fast as him!’ she said cryptically.  Regardless all of this was still the path: tamper with Rox in any way.  The lines lasted long but nothing came of them as the survivors slowly turned on each other.
Looking down at the 2991, he figured he has spent at least 700 or more times exploring various paths with the tamper with Rox path, each minor choice sometime spilling him into an entirely new room.  There was no way to know if some very specific combination would pull him out of this path, but operating under the thought that these loops may not last forever he figured it was time to look in other directions.  If this was eternity he could always go back.  He asked Rox a few times, but she never responded in any way beyond a ‘what do you mean?’ crazy look she gave him.  It was frustrating because quite clearly she played a role in this, but as of now would not divulge anything.
He could do nothing, like he was doing this time, and that too was a choice.  H, he hadn’t often done this so was not sure what the next room looked like, and prepared himself for many painful bashings against the walls before his blind self could figure out anything as to real choice.
The ending goal was not clear, and it was with some reluctance he thought there was an above zero chance there was no goal.  That thought was disturbing that he would be permanently stuck in a resetting reality where he could act freely for whatever he wanted to do for a few cycles on this icy planet before it blew up and reset.  The obvious goal perhaps was him surviving, but there were plenty of times he had made it ‘to the end’ and even a couple where he had repaired the reactor enough to get a few more cycles out of it but it always still ended.
This time Railine would focus on trying various ways to increase his memory of the past resets.  Writing helped only that it would occasionally be placed deeper in his mind and would seem to carry over slightly better.  Recordings did nothing.  He think thought he tried drawing once, but couldn’t remember.
More gunfire.  Hmm, this was interesting.  This normally only happened with Railine’s escalation or if Zaier was here, but he was at his typical off-base mission.  Railine could not remember all loops as it was impossible, but there was a general pattern as was slowly being figured out.  What this suggested was that there were other actors here that were slowly changing or experimenting also.  
To be expected, he supposed,; but it did fundamentally change things.  Not like Railine was the only one in this.  It added to a massive complication already, as Railine thought if he was not the first to ‘wake up’, at least very near the first, as there appeared to be little changes beyond an expected random permutation.  But to those waking up later, it would be nearly impossible to understand causality, as there would be endless free will in action and no longer a correlation.  It would no longer be simple ‘I do A, it causes B’, as the decision to save someone which would normally endear them, would instead make them they decide to kill their savior just to ‘see what happens’.
The firing was getting more intense.  Railine picked up his axe and left the room, heading outside in the blizzard over to the abandoned shack where many people were killed over the timesmultiple loops.  It only happened later in a loop, if at all, and would be quiet for a long time.  He sat down, sacrificing this loop to merely gather his thoughts and see if there was any way to maximize how much he could learn and tell his future self.
Perhaps the biggest lesson was strong evidence there was others waking up and changing choices to see their own outcome.  Dead Rox once said her line about figuring it out ‘almost as fast as him’, a male who was ahead of Railine, but there was so little he could figure from that.   Her general coy behavior suggested that she was allied with that male, meaning she was helping him more than the nonexistent assistance he got from her.  
This was a very escalating issue if others were coming into it, because the entire almost bifurcating linearity he was envisioning the future unfolding as could legitimately be in jeopardy and be ultimately useless.  He operated under a model of ‘Choice A leads me to either room 1, 2, or 3 based on following actions’ and eliminated choices based on failed rooms.  But what if this two dimensional view of time paths was wrong, and a choice that seemed wrong to Railine actually needed someone else, and Choice A now led to room 17, 21, and 113?
Hope didn’t matter, but he deeply hoped that would not be the case as it would be impossible to figure out.
The wind howled at the cracks in the wood as he sat down and got down to mental, or perhaps spiritual, work.
His eyes were closed and he was in a deep state of meditation thinking about the ways things were occurring when an explosion knocked him out of it enough.  He stood up, peeaked between some cracks in the structure, and saw a section of Alpha Wing on fire.  He took a step out of pure reaction to rush to go help anyone injured and put the fire out.  But the act was useless given the higher nature of what was going on here.
He fished out the necklace he wore.  I, it was small, angular looking, almost like an ancient ninja throwing star in some ways.  ‘I realize apologies will do nothing, but all of this is on the hope I can be redeemed,.’ h He said to himself, thinking of his dead sister.  
Someone very well could be trapped, or dying in there but at this point it didn’t matter, a very weird irony to him.  If it at all mattered he would be there, but he knew something critical needed to happen to stop the loops and at this point it hadn’t been triggered.
‘Where is she?’ h His young self had asked his parents as they were crying and hugging each other in the night as their house was on fire in front of them.  ‘Where!?’
‘She is still inside,’ his Dad cowardly admitted.
‘Why didn’t you go in after her!?  Why did you even leave!?’  The passion of youth burned strong in him.
‘The heat, it was too hot, we had to get out.’  He had begun saying something else but at that point young Railine had already ran begun running towards the house.
The heat was strong;, it hurt more than he would have liked to admit.  ‘Where are you!?’  He dashed in deeper, covering his face, coughing from the smoke asnd he huddled low and moved quickly through their house.  Nanites gave a small degree of protection but fire is potent and it was burning his skin.
The rage in his heart at his parents pushed him on, mixed with a sense of duty that he would literally die before he gave up on his sister that sent him deeper into a suicidal mission.  The feelings were so strong they almost rivaled the pain he was enduring as he stumbled a few times in his low dash forward.
He found her halfway out of her bedroom door.  He jerked grabbed at her and realized pulled, realizing the door was caught on her.  He stood up, feeling the vastly more hot temperature in only a short distance.  He slammed the door over and over, a deep fear that he was not strong enough was biting at his consciousness.
‘No…NO!’  He summoned all the remaining strength he could and slammed into the door, tears steaming off his face as he was pressing into the door, dragging her through it.  She was clear and the door slammed closed.  At this point he was dizzy and rapidly fatiguing out.  He bent down, strugglinged with getting her small body over his shoulder, and with all the final speed and will he could muster started the long run towards the escape.
His love for her drove him on past the point of exhaustion.  He was about 30 steps from the door when he, stumbled and took a few more.  He was not going to give up;, she would not die in the fire.  25…24…23…
His eyes blurred, he could hardly breathe and it felt like he was lifting a vehicle on his back; and any more weight and his spine would blow out and he would fall to the ground.
17…16…
His face, hands, arms were blistering.  He would never be the same, that was for sure.  On…on..
11…10…
At this point his eyes had either closed from the pain or had swollen shut.  A large flaming piece of wood had cracked from overhead, swung down and hit him squarely in the face.  He went down as the smoke and flames built up around him so close to the door.…
Later at the hospital it was revealed his scars would be permanent.  He was near N-Limit when he was found, and that caused a shifting of his ‘steady state’ which often occurred in the most extreme of injuries, which was why many people possessed scars despite nanites nearly eradicating them out of the general populace.
None of that really mattered, because the next thing he found out haunted him his whole life: she had died.  He could not see her body, and through begging was given one of the few recognizably things on her: the necklace he now wore.
The recollection brought tears to his face.  ‘I will never give up,.’ h He said to himself.  Others in a similar situation might give into hedonism, depravity, nihilism or anything else, but not Railine.  He was driven from the beginning, he would not let her sacrifice and everything he had done be in vain.  
“I will get out of this.”

Laina
Location: V-Plane on the way initial trip to Reiko-7 initially

 “I really hope  they are still alive, but I am not sure how they could be,” Laina said, attempting to stay hopeful but never remaining unrealistic.  
“That’s why you are here, baby.”
Zaier stood up.,  “Feyria does not see anything on the scanners, so whatever happened here appears to be gone.  I want extreme caution and stay near the plane until we have a better idea.  Laina, Kalco, you two are together.  I want you to give a quick look for survivors. , I’ll stay here with Ryla and monitor the situation.,  Feyria, keep the plane ready.  T, the other five  I want you to stay together and head towards the center then the command center and see what you can find.”
“Zaier,” that fire fighter guy Railine spoke up, “I’d request going with the two of them as well.may I request going along with Kalco and Laina?  Having someone additionally strong, as well as medically skilled would be useful for survivors we find.  We likely are going to encounter obstacles and my familiarity with them as well as my strength could be useful for scouting.”  Laina was somewhat surprised,; he didn’t talk much and the sentence seemed oddly practiced for him
“That sounds appropriate.  Do it.”
“I want to go with them too,” Solide said.  This was weird.  Normally everyone left the two of them alone.  What exactly did they think they were going to encounter?  Kalco was strong, smart, and a fighter, and she was as good as they came medically.  Nothing was wrong with just ICSing for help either.
“No, you go with the others.”
Solide’s next words were under his breath. , “How the fuck did that guy pull this off?”
Kind of weird… - Laina said to Kalco.  He shrugged.
As the plane had landed, the two of them were readying to go out the door while Feyria was still landing.  The larger man came up to the two of them.  In a way Laina was a bit jealous this idiot was here ruining her time with Kalco.  “Sorry for the imposition, but I thought this would be a good idea, all things considered.”  There was a sudden lurch of movement that caused them to all stagger.  H, he seemed like he forced his own stumble, which causing all three of them went to go down.  There was some laughing from those still sitting while the three fought to stand up in the narrow doorway.
Laina brushed part of her hair colic behind her head as she pulled her hood over.  The two of them occasionally interacted due to both being medical in nature, but the difference was night and day between them.  Laina did not harbor a lot of anger in her heart, but medicine was one thing she prided herself on very deeply and to her it was better to never be involved in it, thaen only half-heartedly be so like Railine was.
“Just remember…”
Railine cut her off, “You’re medical lead, I know.”
“How…?”  But she dropped it.  He was just deferring to her perhaps, a good guess and nothing more.
The three of them exited into the stiff breeze as the snow blew around them.  The wind was strong enough that in many areas there was no snow, just the icy ground and in others very tall wind drifts.
“Laina,” Railine began, “sStop me if at any point you find this uncomfortable or presumptuous.  I know we have had problems with each other in the past, but I have a feeling something very bad is coming and I want to know anything you will teach me.”
She turned to face Kalco, but with their winter hoods on, only their eyes were visible, tucked deeply into the advanced clothing.  She was actually pleasantly surprised by his peace offering of sorts, given and giving an admittance of his inferiority to her went a long way as well.
“Sure, when we get back I can run over some things with you.”
“What the hell is this?”  Kalco was pointing with his pistol at a pile of black things.  He walked up and gave a fuel drum a kick, it moved away easily.
“LDumped it out, look, ashes,” she said while scraping away some of the snow that had blown over the area.
“Why burn something when their base was burning down?”  Kalco asked, getting closer to the black pile.
Laina was about to make a move when Railine was already grabbing Kalco’s hand.  “I wouldn’t, it’s likely infectious.  Everything at this base is likely infectious.  I  and would touch nothing.”  That was about the same warning she was going to give him.  
“Don’t tell Zaier,.”  Railine saidcontinued.
“…What?”  Kalco asked.  
“I suspect you might want to give him an update, but don’t bother.  T there are some things we need to do first.”  He walked over to the barrel.,  “Don’t be surprised.,”  Hhe kicked it some to turn it around until it was showing frozen flesh that had been ripped off and stuck to the barrel, there was blood near the opening.  It looked like a desperate scene to open it up.
“What the fuck?”
“How did you know?”  Laina asked the strange fire fighter.
“I will tell you when we get inside so the other’s can’t hear, but let’s just say I am not here because I am a fire fighter.”
The two of them and the odd man continued inwards, crawling through a small hole they wedged open.  Inside, the scene was dismal and destruction was everywhere.  Laina looked at the way they had come and the door was bashed outwards.
“As you can see, there was a fight inside here.  As you may be guessing, the fight likely occurred in here first, and whatever happened out there came later,” Railine oddly explained.  Kalco went marching over, ready to grab his shoulder when he spun quite skillfully and took a step back.  “Don’t try it.  It never ends goodwell.”
Kalco smirked,.  “That so?”  He dashed at him, swinging his left fist. , Railine dodged his head to the side, and moved behind him.  Kalco threw a reverse elbow trying to catch him, and Railine evaded that as well.  Kalco threw a few more attacks before he tried to grapple Railine in which he ducked down and spun around him.
“Stop,” Railine said firmly.
“Stop it!”  Laina yelled,; this was not going to go goodwell.  Kalco hated being shown up, and Railine displayed skills she was legitimately surprised about, but would not hold up against a Classed Soldier like Kalco.
“You don’t beat me physically, not anymore.”
“I always win.  Naturally.”  He pulled out Aelishun and aimed it at Railine.
“Don’t!”  Laina yelled.  What was happening?  They were supposed to be looking for survivors and these stupid males were having their ape dance of dominance  like idiots all over always did.
“She’ll fix you after I am through with you.”  He squeezed the trigger while it was aiming at his head.  Nothing happened.  He squeezed again, then ran his hands over it making sure it was cycling.  “What the fuck!?”
“Sorry, it took a while to figure out how to stop that one.,”  hHe was holding up a small black block with a white bar down the middle of it. Laina did not know what it was.
Kalco lowered his pistol.,  “Wow…clever bastard…w  When?”
“When we were landing.”
Kalco laughed hard,.  “I wondered why you were so grabby, never thought you’d go for the magazine.”  Laina sighed, thinking they had reached some agreement and they could get on with it.  He let his pistol go, as it wound up to his waist.  “Fine, I don’t need a gun to beat you.”  She was wrong, never underestimate male desire for dominance it seemed.
Kalco launched a smooth flow of attacks, opening with a front kick that he transitioned into a spinning back kick off his back leg.  Railine stayed away from them like a practiced fighter.  He threw a few more punches, closing the distance and going for an elbow, but Railine ducked again and was behind him, his arms around his neck in a choke hold.  He was whispering harshly, and she only caught a few words, “…know what…you’re…lisha …”
“Fucking…” Kalco gasped out, thrashing and trying to get out of the hold.
“You need to listen, this is like Elyria…it’s the Modality,.”  Railine said more normally.
Kalco instantly became disarmed.  Railine let go and pushed him hard away from him.  He coughed a few times.
“What the fuck are you?”
“A Solarian, believe it or not.  I’ve been through hell and back.  I am a Classed Soldier, Intel.”
“Bullshit,” Kalco shot back.  “You’re Strive is way wrong.  They aren’t your frame either.  Zaier is probably an Intel, but not you.”
Railine looked calm,.  “Then you haven’t seen all of them, have you?  I do not have time to argue, the other’s will be here soon.  I was assigned here because we have reason to believe this is like the Elyria you survived.”
Laina walked over to Kalco, grasping his hand.  His hand hung thereir limp.  “How the fuck do you know that?”
“I am an Intel, I already told you.  I know your truth too, you heard me whisper it.  D, do you want me to tell her?” h he asked as he pointed to Laina.  What was he talking about?  She had known Kalco a long time since they were here.  She understood he could not tell her everything, but there wasn’t much he was likely hiding.
“How many…” Kalco asked
“Two,” Railine answered.
“Now?”  Laina looked down at Kalco holding three fingers behind him.
“Three.”
“Where…” Kalco was cut off.
“You’re from Lia, but lived mostly on Ae.”
Kalco staggered back.,  “Holy shit…and I thought I knew what was going on.”
Laina tugged at his jacket,.  “What is going on?  I have never seen you act this way.”
Railine took a step towards them.,  “Deep apologizesapologies.  This was the only way that worked, and I understand your confusion.’
Kalco lifted a hand,.  “So this one goes Modal?”
Railine nodded.  “That’s why you are here, among others.  Reiko-10 is already overran.”
Laina felt her stomach drop out, but it was recovered;, no way it was true.  “How do you know?”
“I can’t tell you that.”
She turned to Kalco, she was way out of the loop here.  “What is the modal?”
Hey, haven’t heard from you guys, please go check the dogs first. – Rox said to the three of them.
Laina was bothered by Rox’s interruption.  There was something occurring here, and so many things seemed to be happening beyond typical events.  Rox had always left felt like the ‘sand-bag’  type of being far more clever than her dumb antics let on.
“We should go that way to buy time.,”  Iin a weird reversal Railine was now the leader of their little party.
The three of them walked over to the door.  The door was still in good shape, but it did not automatically open.  Laina pulled out her sword, ready to cut it open.,  Railine held his hand up, and walked forward.  He triggered the manual override and slid it out of the way.  “Try before you pry.”
“I…should have thought of that.”
“Usually you do,.”  Railine said, but it did not make sense.
“What do you know about Elyria?”  Kalco asked.
“Almost everything.  It happens more than just there, and it happens here.  Tell Laina so she knows.”
“Tell me please, I am so lost right now.”
She could see on his face he was pissed at being told what to do, and anxious because there was so much he needed to know.  
“Okay, listen close.  M, my last major mission , it was supposed to be this rescue mission on this some colony.  We go in, and we start getting massacred by these creatures, but we regroup and find the civilians, we start pulling them out, when…one of them turns.”
“Turns?” s She asked.  “Against you?”
“Oh yeah.  It turned into this demon and wiped us the fuck out.  There were three other teams in there and it was a nightmare.  Fuck…it was just a little kid.”
“What are you talking about?”
“They can appear as us.  They know your memories or something, they acted so normal, then boom, raining death and annihilating four squads.”
Railine was looking at the walls as they walked down.,  “Small caliber…they never stood a chance against the True Forms.”
“How did you know that word?!”  
“Intel, I told you.”
Kalco gritted his teeth and let it go.
Railine closed his eyes for a moment, and then started coughing, but it sounded very forced.  Laina thought she heard something cry in the distance.  She tried listening closely, but his forced coughing distracted her enough she could not tell for sure.
They had got to the end where the dogs were kept.  Opening the door their suit lights danced around the room.  Kalco walked in first.  Railine lightly grabbed Laina’s shoulder.  “I know there were four times you didn’t save someone…”
Her heart dropped;, the number four of course hung in her brain so strongly.  She could remember each of their dying breaths, their look on their face as they slipped past the border of life.  The regret that if she only knew more, only got there faster, only had a different piece of equipment.
“We carry weights in our heart, but you have used that as a tool of self-hate.”
“How the hell do you know this!?”  Swearing was rare for Laina.  
“I have seen your files.  I know far more than anyone else here.  Please, you must tell me.  That hate causes so much pain in the future.”
“Laina?”  Kalco asked.  He stood there stupidly holding a frozen water bowl.
She looked at Railine, and despite his strange words the entire time, his face looked very sincere.
“I lost my sister in a fire, and it took me a very long time to get over that hate.  That is why I became what I did, to never let it happen to others. , I may sympathize with you more than you think.  Why did these four aeffect you so deep?  Please tell me!”  
Kalco dropped the bowl and came out in case it was a fight.
His words struck her and felt almost a tear come to her.  “I was in an early medical class as a child.  M, my instructor was killed because of illegal activities he was doing.  It was the first time I saw death.  H, he was bleeding out as the assassins shot him and left him to die.  Knowing what I know now I probably could have saved him.”
“You didn’t know at the time.”
“Ignorance is not an excuse.   Later near the end of training, I had felt a bit too cocky and had skipped a class on equipment I knew how to run.  C, circumstantially later that when I was doing my rotation,  when we needed it, but the battery was too low.  But and I both didn’t check, and didn’tnor did I know how to swap it in.  My arrogance had cost that person their life.”
“Unfortunate, admittedly, but the previous person could be to blame too, for not changing batteries.”
“I don’t blame others.  The next two were mostly the same. , I was with two separate assault teams, and I got first to pick of which one I was going with.  The first one time I chose the team expecting more action, and it was the other that got ambushed.  The second time I had a choice was I chose the team with the cuter guy, and the other got hit.  Both of those soldier’s were alive for a fraction of time.  I, if I was there, I could have saved them.
“You are blaming a whimsical fate for that.”
“No.  My own misguided desire, both for action and for something as stupid as that he washim being cute, cost them.  There were four people I could have saved, and that are now gone forever.  Forever!” s She yelled at him.  Did he understand the magnitude of that word?
“I see.  T, that belief is a hard one to erase.  Come here.,” Railine led her away, and Kalco dropped the bowl  and followed after.  He Railine pushed open the door of the next room, and inside was a crystal growth that radiated a soft light.  The energy felt warm to her, it felt familiar.  She wanted to touch it.”
“You must never touch this.  It is something you might come to understand.  It kills most of us when we are around it long enough, but for others, like you, it changes you.  I have seen the data.”  The last part seemed like he added it on.
“What is it?”
“You could call it a type of manifested life energy, a frequency deadly to many of us.”
Down the hall the doorway was knocked over.  That angry guard came running after them, his gun out in front.
“What the fuck are you hoping to do here?”  Solide yelled at Railine.  “I stopped Eve every time and it doesn’t matter.  Zaier goes down, and if somehow both are spared other’s still go down from the suspicion.”
“We are in purgatory.  Don’t you get that?”  Railine said to the angry man.
“The fuck you talking about?”
“You have seen the ends, no one is enough.  What is your record?  I got seven , and the reactor repaired, and it still resets.”
“Seven?  Fuck.”  Solide had been disarmed by the strange words.
“Every one of us here has darkness in our hearts, even the two of us who seem to resonate the strongest.  Why you were one, I have no idea, but we need to redeem each of us, and then we can get out.”
“You think some bullshit like that works?”  
“I have tried nearly everything else.”
“Everyone?”  Solide asked.
“One way or another.”
Kalco had walked up and was in front of Laina.  “What the hell is going on here?”
Railine sighed deeply, ignoring Kalco and Laina.,  “Anyway, in case you didn’t know, Laina bears self hate for letting four people die in the past.”
“That is her sin?  Holy fuck, that’s nothing.”
Railine slammed his fist hard on the wall.,  “You can’t judge!  You don’t know how it affected her.  She has to realize saving someone is her role, to make her be whole again.”
“Wow you are so into this voodoo shit.”
“Tell me I am wrong.”
Solide laughed manically.,  “The fucked up thing is, I can’t.”
Railine looked back at her and Kalco for a moment before facing Solide.,  “Anyway, this Fate Line is pretty messed up now.  I assume you have yours ?”
Solide said nothing.  Together the two of them pulled out what looked like explosives.
“Uh…what?”  Kalco asked.  Laina was too shocked, and moments later all of them were caught in the explosive inferno.

Zaier
Location: Ancient Ship

Zaier did not like being corrected, but Railine had a sufficient point about the fact that the away team did not possess adequate healing capabilities.  It was somewhat problematic that the people left back at the base were a bit hot-headed but with Laina in command over there it should be okay as long as Rox and Solide stayed away from each other.
One thing he liked about the man was that he pretty quickly understood the threat they were dealing with here could be very real.  He had heavy battle armor on and had a flame thrower along with a rocket launcher.  Normally Zaier would never be okay with someone walking around with that much fire power but with only ten people left due to some alien force he liked the prudence the fire fighter  had.  Evidently he had much more combat training than he let on.  
Madigan was melting the entry to the hallway of the strange anomaly in the side of the mountain.  Railine had walked up to him, as the entry was almost open.  “Hey, uh…what’s that over there ?”  Madigan turned to where Railine was pointing.  Zaier looked in the same direction and saw nothing.  When he turned back Railine was gone.
“Where the hell did he go?”  Kalco asked.
“He ran down there,” Madigan pointed after.  “Normally he is more slow-paced.”
“We proceed as normal,” Zaier said.
As tThey proceeded down the tunnel, it slowly became obvious they were in some sort of structure.  They were slowly exploring when they heard a strange sound further down like a cry or a roar.  There was a loud ‘Zinnng’ sound before a loud explosive.
“That was his Linear Launcher he had on his back,” Kalco said.
“He’s probably fighting, we need to go save him,” Madigan said.
“Yeah, let’s go.”
There was a ripping sound and a large wave off heat coming from one of the hallways.  There was a red light coming from one of the corners down the hallway the four of them were after.  There was a ‘wooohhhhsss’ sound of liquid and the four of them came into a room that was on fire on the other side.  By the time they had got there, whatever was happening was over.
“What is this?”  Zaier asked himRailine.
“I assume if I told you I heard a sound, that wouldn’t be believable?” h He asked.  Whatever occurred was over at this point, and he was not hit in any capacity.  Zaier stared at him, deciding what to say.  “I hope you won’t judge me, but I possess a strong Chrono Psionic and I knew we were going to be ambushed here, and I had to stop it before anyone here was hit.”
Zaier walked near him, seeingthere was a pink glass pane stuck into the wall;, it had pierced into it deeply.  What exactly had he fought here?  “Do you see anything else?”
“No, not yet.  I simply had to stop that.”
“That is a pretty potent Psionic,” Kalco’s voice had a tone of disbelief in it.
“I am impressed, I didn’t think you hadve that in you,.”  Feyria strolled up to Railine and drifted her hand across his back that was armored.
“It might not be as impressive if you knew what it was like,” he said while looking at her.  Zaier was caught a bit off guard by him.  H, he was pretty good at looking at people for a single moment and knowing how pathetic they are and knowing their life.  He thought he had this guy pinned down, but his face had a hardness to it that he never noticed before.
“There is more to you than meet’s the eye,” Feyria was flirting with himflirtte.  
“Sad it takes violence to cause that reaction,” he said to her,.  Zaier smirked to himself seeing her shut down with the backhanded insult.
“We should split up.,  Kalco and Madigan, check this floor.  T, the three of us will go down to the next floor.”  Zaier wanted to spend some time with him, he was intriguing to himintrigued by his odd behavior.  That was a rarity he would not let go.
The three of them went past the flaming corner of the ship that where Railine had killed some unknown creature while they were walking across a deep chasm.
“Check it out, I think we are in a building or something,” Feyria noted.   sShe moved forward a bit and a railing phased into view;, she backed up and it faded away.  She repeated it twice, laughing to herself.  “Still active.  W, wasn’t Reiko-10  supposed to be uninhabited?”
“Ancient ship.  Early Aelisha origin, but likely some race that predated them,” Railine replied as he pointed far below him.  There were large gold slabs that, looking close, solely moved up and down in some sort of pattern that from here could not be discerned.
Zaier was suspicious.,  “How do you know that?”
“Ask Madigan, he can confirm it.  He was telling me about the engineering once.”
The excuse might have been fake, but sounded legitimate enough Zaier could not press.
Railine turned to Zaier.,  “You seem like someone that likes a good thought experiment.  I, if this was once another race’s ship, but the Aelisha took it, whose’s ship is it?”
“The Aelisha’s.,”  Tthat seemed pretty obvious to him.
“Yeah, that seems obvious to me alsoI would say that too,” Feyria said. 
Railine walked near the edge of the long passage.  The drop was likely ten stories or more below them.  He rested his arms on the energy railing;, in the heavy battle armor that guy looked like there was much more to him than just some damage control he was supposed to be here for.  Zaier had been through enough missions in the past to know when ‘extra talent’ was on the scene, and that is likely what might have happened here.  He dDid not feel like a Classed, but could not be know for sure.
“I find it interesting you two think that.  Allow me to modify it a bit.”  He turned to face them and, he un-strapped the axe off his back that he had picked up at Reiko-7.  “Whose’s axe is this, mine or the previous owner?”
“Yours” they both answered.
“Why?  That seems a bit of an inconsistency .”
 “Well he is dead,” Feyria said.
Zaier was amused.  A, at this point Railine’s logic was lacking but it had been a while since anyone approached him with anything mentally stimulating.  “If the guy was alive, I think he would argue quite vocally it was his, but he is not, so it’s yours.”
“It being in my hands means nothing if he were alive?”
“Hardly ,” Zaier said.
He rolled the axe around a bit in his hands.  The man had a toned frame to him.  He was not the size of Kalco or especially Solide, but he had a solid build to him.  The axe looked easily utilized by him.  “Let’s say it is some guy who is dead at Seven.  I don’t much like this grip and shaft though.  So I change the shaft, is it still ‘my’ axe?  Is it the same one?”
“Still yours from an ownership view,” Feyria said.
“But not the same axe,” Zaier said definitively.
“Interesting.,”  Railine smiled at him.  O, on his tired face the movement seemed sincere and it excited him.  “Let’s say I replace the head later as well, is it the same axe I had at Seven?”
“No.”
“Not a chance.,”  Zaier was glad Feyria agreed with him;, maybe on a subconscious level this is why they liked each other.
“Would it interest you to know that I truly believe it is the same axe?”  Railine saidasked.  Above and behind them he heard the two other men moving around;, Zaier hoped they didn’t come down here, this was starting to intrigue him.
“I’d like to know how that is possibly defensible.”
“Wait,” Feyria said she walked up to Railine, pointing at the weapon,.  “So we are saying it is yours, you change the handle, and then the edge part, and we are assuming that the axe is only two pieces, you’re claiming it’s still the same one?”
He nodded, and she immediately laughed.
“Tell me why you think that.,”  Zaier did not like Feyria’s distraction.
“It was mine through time.  I held possession of its essence at all times.  It was always ‘Railine’s axe’.  This is of course the most extreme of the position, and I still stand by it.  Imagine the V-Plane we took here, Feyria.  Is it not the V-Plane because a few bolts have to be replaced?”
“Well I am opposed to this whole idea of ownership.  I, and it either is or isn’t something.”
Zaier finally realized what he was getting at. , “This is a backdoor about the Ship of Thessus, am I right I assume?.”
Railine lifted his right hand, pulling away the armor from his next neck slightly.  I, it adjusted very subtly to give him more room there.  “Of course, I am glad you know it.”
“I don’t get it,” Feyria mumbled as she looked to Zaier for guidance.  A, a lot of people were always lost in life and they needed people like him to straighten them out.
“A thought puzzle.  If a ship is slowly replaced piece by piece as it travels around, and at some point in the future every piece has been changed, is it the same ship?”  He was talking to Feyria but was looking at the stoic-faced Railine.
“Of course not.”
“I agree with you.  Now, let’s say we had all the old pieces that were swapped out, and we built a ship out of that, is that the original ship?”
“Uh…yeah?  Does anyone legitimately think different?”
“Illogically some do,” Zaier said, turning to Feyria.
“I do.”  
Zaier and Feyria of course grinned between themselves.
Railine spoke, “This axe has what I put it through, it’s a concept beyond just an object.  The ship has the tears, the adventures, the spirit of those on it.  It’s not a single board that contains that.”
“Certainly,” Feyria lifted a hand up, “but all the boards contain that, all the original boards.”
“Are you the same Feyria?  Your cells constantly die and renew, almost a complete overhaul a few times in a life time.”
“I am way different. , I am different than I was as an adolescent, or as a kid.”
“I agree with her,” Zaier said.  “I may be ‘Zaier’ but the Zaier as a kid isn’t making the same decisions I make now.”
Railine shook his head. , “How can you say that?  You absolutely have to believe in the continuality or you may legitimately conclude every morning you are a different person who inherited a body you have only for some short time.”
“I thought about that before!  That is why I value fun, I can’t honestly say I am the same person tomorrow,” Feyria said.
Zaier was not going that far as she was,.  “You are trying to conflate a few things here, do not think I fail to see it.”
“Do you guys not believe in the Line?” h He asked them.
“Ohr I do.  But I believe it’s more of just my energy. , I am more on the scale that when I am gone, that is that.  Not a big believer in Ghosts, or anything along those lines,” Feyria answered.  She was leaning against the railing, one athletic leg crossed over the other.
Zaier was hesitant to trust that railing, as if it failed the two others  were likely dead.  “Sure I do.  I think it demonstrates my point completely.  W, when I die I don’t retain some coherent vital ‘thing’, it is diffused out and recycled.”
“My axe was once some other man’s, and it slowly loses his essence while growing with mine.”
“And?”  Zaier was confused what this had to do with the Line.
“If the universe eventually collapses, and explodes again and somehow life occurs exactly the same way, and there is a Zaier stuck in this ship in the future, is he you?”
“Nope.  My consciousness dies.”
“Of which, it may not even last to the next day,” Railine said.  He sighed,.  “I get it, I really do.  But I do not agree in the slightest.  Here is one more for you, let’s say you were stuck in a time loop.  You die in mere moments now, but time resets to the start of this day.  Are ‘you’ back there?”
“No.  Why would consciousness do that?  It implies it has some dimensional component to it.”
“I agree.  That’s why if we ever had teleporters that like replicated our selves exactly at another spot I would never take it, since there’s no way it’s me getting off of that,” Feyria said.
Zaier enjoyed this distraction but it was time to move on.  “Why are you asking all this?  I find it fascinating, but hardly the right time, all things considered.”
“I am trying to find out if there is a correlation.”
“To what?”
“To what is happening,” he said.
Feyria asked him, “You don’t think you are the same person, do you?”
He was fishing for something in his backpack.  “Of course I do.  If I believed I was a new person…” he let the words drop, “I could never do what needs to get done.  I would give up.”
Zaier looked at Feyria and they both shrugged.
Zaier was about to say something when he realized Railine held a set of explosives in his hand.
“I am Railine, and I have lived through thousands of deaths, and me, the real Railine, is making it out of here.”
Zaier did not have much time to process it when the explosives went off.  I, if they were not killed instantly, getting knocked to the crushing plates below would have finished the job.

Railine
Location: Solide’s Room, Living Quarters

He was holding the modified Flame Dancer in his hand.  I, it had been tuned for maximum destructive power in a narrow cone of fire.  The settings on the flame thrower were easy enough to dump more fuel on the trigger squeeze, but a subtle change to the actual fuel itself proved a huge boon as well.  On his back he also had the Linear Launcher he had taken a liking to along with the axe from Reiko-7.  At thise point the axe could not do much versus the True Forms, and was mostly as a sentimental token of everything that had occurred.
Like the man across from them him, they bothhe had on heavy battle armor that would have weighed too much to carry far on their own normally, but were was fully internally powered to help reduce the weight.  Both of their helmets were off simply to facilitate conversation in a more natural way.
“How many we at?”  Solide nodded towards Railine.  He clicked a button on his wrist, the powered gauntlet coming off,; on this hand was the number 17.  “Only seventeen hundred?  That doesn’t seem right.”
“Thousand,” Railine said.  The word hung heavy in the air.
“Fuck.,”  Solide shook his head.
“You ask that every time.”
“I keep hoping there is no way it’s true.”  On Solide’s own arm he had the number 669;, it was the most accurate way they could come up with.  Railine had 17 for a long time, and would need about 300 more from Solide before it dutifully changed to an 18.  Specific iterations in the thousands blurred together and they shared the load for remembering.  “And you are seriously telling me you never tried banging any of these bitches any of these times?”
“Never.”
“You gay?”
Railine laughed;, he had never had a problem directly but they were not enough alike that he would normally associate with him.  Chronologically, they knew each other for only a relatively short period of time, but Fate-wise they knew each other pretty well.  “Given what was occurring, it never seemed the appropriate response.  I can tell you didn’t conclude the same.”
“Fuck no.  F, for a while I had no clue what was going on, I knew it wasn’t a Sense I had with me,.”
Railine cut in, “See, for me for a long time I thought that all the visions I was having was perhaps a latent Psionic being manifested.”
Solide shrugged. , “Guess that’s a no for both of us.  Yeah, I stopped giving a shit after a while, but what really pissed me off was that I was tired and sore at the start of this bullshit.  You know how frustrating that was, or is I guess.”
“Let me guess,  you ‘banged’ them all except Aria.”
Solide laughed heartedly.,  “Close.  I got her too.”
Railine’s face showed dissatisfaction,.  “I am skeptical.  S, she would not have done it with just anyone.  Unless I didn’t really know her.  Given the perverse way we know things now, that could be possible.”
He continued laughing.,  “Just fFucking with you.  I never did.  I tried for a while too, but she’s just too frigid.  Haha, I even tried grabbing her a few times, but that bitch is strong.  Great legs and ass though.”
“You do know why she is, right?”
The man with his spiked back hair nodded.,  “Yeah.  Ryla never gave it up either.,”  Hhe shook his head, his eyes dazed in a style rare for him.  “Damn it, she has such a nice fucking pair for her age…”  Looking at Railine. , “What, you aren’t going to agree?  You are definitely gay.”
Railine turned his head ever so slightly,.  “You never pieced it together?  You were sore every time because that was your prior condition coming into the loop .  How much more clearclearer do I need to say it, that there was a reason me and Aria both had zero sexual interest at the start of the loop.”
“What?  What!?  Are you shitting me right now?”  Railine gave him this perfect smile that could not be deduced as real or a joke.  “You little shit, you did fuck her, didn’t you?”
Something crashed on the outside. , Railine swung, lifting his gun, his body switching to battle mode.  A few moments later, he realized it was just the wind.  Mentally a large weight had formed in his mind.  He could fight and survive very well, but had a sort of permanent ‘shell shock’ to him that was only alleviated because each day reset until his mind loosely remembered the deaths.  Solide did not seem nearly as scarred, and Railine thought that it had something to do with Rox being his ‘special friend’.
The three dogs were in the room with them.  Ricochet had lifted his head and his large brown ears were looking towards the door, but then sat his head back down.  “I am glad you are okay with the dogs being here with us,” Railine said.
“They saved my ass a few times, I enjoy their company.  Seriously, did you ever find out what Ryla is?”
Railine shook his head no. , “I tried a lot of different ways.  There was always this edge.  If I attacked her, I could never fully kill her without her healing and killing me, or I could just use an Axl weapon and blow her away.”  Railine scoffed at his own words. , “Disgusting really, talking about shooting little Ryla.”
“Fuck that.  Just an appearance she has.  Same deal with me though.  Never got anything out of her.”
“It’s cCommendable in a certain way, given how many times we have tried things.  An unbreakable tenacity you wouldn’t expect just looking at her.”
Solide had taken the gauntlets off his hands, and rubbed his left hand through his hair.  “Anyway, I think we both agree she apparently is on our side for this at least.”
Railine pet the dog Rhett with his right hand as it has its ears back and welcomed tohe soft touch.  “Let’s talk about something more serious and that’s what we have found out about the others.”
Solide had knelt down, and then leaned against the wall to relax.  The old shack’s  wall’s groaned with the battle armor leaning against it.  “I’ll call Rox.”
“Do you have to?”
“You don’t like her?”
“Oh, I got along great with her under normal circumstances, but it feels strange given her role in all this, especially to talk openly.”
Solide kept his gaze on him. , “She is on our side, you know.”
“I don’t doubt that necessarily, but the help she gives us is nearly non-existent.”
“I know.  Effects the Fate Line or some shit she always says .”
A new female voice was in the room.  Rox had not walked in, as she was merely there the next moment.,  “Hey!  I heard that.”
“Hey,” Railine said, no shame in his voice.
“Not embarrassed I caught you?” s She asked Railine.  The dogs all became aware of her presence and bounded over to her.  Their tails were wagging as they were all wrestleding trying to get close.  There was a bit of growling. , “Hey, there’s enough to go around for all you guys!”  She laughed as they were licking her face.
“No.  You do this all the time.”  He paused and a quick question came to him, “So I don’t want to get into his general depravity, but from your point of view, why was it okay that you guys likely wasted countless loops – of which everyone here died gruesome deaths over and over – while you guys were likely having sex for your own pleasure?”
She answered indirectly, “That reasoning  sounds a lot like some I have heard from MalAxl harmonic types:, let’s minimize pain and do that by killing everyone permanently.”
Railine showed both his open palms,.  “You know my frequency, that’s not an issue.  T, to me the hedonism seems detrimental.”
She turned to Solide. , “Is he always this much of a stick in the mud?”
“Usually.”
She turned back, her longer hair spun a bit further by being amplified by the weight of the beads she wore.  “The answer, partly is that it is a necessary component of synchronizing with Solide, and it just feels good too.”
He put a hand on his hip., “You are not seriously telling me that an Aeon like you has to have sex with her target?”
Rox laughed. , “I really could pull your leg so bad right now.  No, of course not.  That is just something that works, and for him, it is especially effective.  I dislike that term Aeon.”
“That is what you basically are, using the Gnostic view anyway, that’s one of the closest similarities I can think of.  That makes a lot of sense, because then the True Forms are like Archons.”
“I don’t know what the fuck you are referring to, but why would a Solarian religion be right?”  Solide asked.
“I am not saying it is, just there are some serious overlaps, and am wondering if there is a reason for that.  Rox?”
Rox didn’t answer and instead changed topics. , “Did you know some pairs are not physical with each other at all?  Though uUsually it has to do withit’s when the target is really young.”
“How boring,.”  Solide said.  “You have some attributes that are fun to exploit.”
He Railine looked at his friend,.  “You do know she is probably exploiting you, right?”  Railine pointed at her, thenm the sitting man.  This reminded him of his earlier thought that the universe’s workings were probably something he could not hope to understand, and having a being like Rox comfort Solide might make some sense.  Railine was not jealous of the sex, but on some level was envious of the ease Solide had whereas Railine had a constant level of stress and high-strung anxiety that never went away.  “Why you two?  Why him?”
Rox laughed. , “I ask myself that every time.  Fate works in mysterious ways.  LineGods end up in these fractures a lot.”
Solide brushed his hand away, as if to dismiss her. , “Makes you wonder if they are the ones that cause them, doesn’t it?”
“Stop being so mean!”
Railine didn’t bother with her antics,.  “I loosely get it, but where is my…you or pair or whatever?”  Perhaps he was desperate to be relieved in some way, that someone, somewhere telling could tell him this nightmare was okay.  That he would make it through and not be permanently messed up hearing small sounds around him or thinking a person was going to explode into a True Form.
“I knew you wanted to fuck her!  I bet I can let you just to prove you aren’t gay.”  Solide was bantering, but Railine was dead serious.
Rox answered somberly, “I do not know.  I am legitimately surprised you don’t, given the Axl frequency.”
“Kind of strange the harmonics, or frequency…, fuck are those even interchangeable?” Solide asked.
Rox shrugged. , “Very loosely, but keep going.”
“…Anyway that it builds up over these time fractures.  Is it that it actually accumulates, or do we just harmonize better?”  He pulled out the Axl weapon in the form of a shotgun.  “I could never use Hrunting initially, but now it’s fine.”
“A little the former, mostly the later,” Rox again answered.
“If she was this serious all the time, maybe I’d invite her to our secret clubhouse  more often,” Railine joked, but his tone was somber.  
Solide laughed hard and Rox frowned in an exaggerated way far beyond what a Solarian could do.
“I deeply appreciate your carefree attitude, I do, but to me it seems so badly misplaced,” Railine told her.
“I kind of understand that, but when you die, for real I mean, you’ll see that your worry and stress is what is misplaced.”
Railine looked to Solide;, he had an unsure look and shrugged.
“Care to expand?”
The athletic woman in her winter clothes looked small compared to the men in their battle suits.  “Can’t.  Too close to changing Fate by saying anything else.”
“Okay well, we sufficiently have wasted enough time, we need to get down to business here.  I will start,: are we the only two that have an awareness of what is going on?”  Railine asked Solide,; at this point Rox graciously bowed out with a literal bow as she stood silently in the corner.  She waved the dogs over and they all giddily pranced over while she was silently petting all of them.
He took a deep breath in, holding it for a while with his eyes closed.  Railine patiently waited while he put his thoughts together.  “No, Kalco definitely shows some sign of getting it, mostly around areas where a lot of people have died, he gets wary.”  He looked displeased while shaking his head slowly. , “Can’t say for sure, but I think Ryla gets it too.”
Railine had his hand on his chin. , “Two aliens…”  At this point both men were beyond suspecting anything of the other.  Theyn had been through too much, and each in his dark way had confirmed multiple times in the past they were indeed ‘just Solarian’.
“This is pure speculation here, but Kalco I think gets it almost the same way we do, whereas Ryla is something different.”
Railine nodded. , “I agree, but her case is very tough to pin down.  She shows wariness like Kalco does at strong Emotion Field locations, like you ever see her when we first come back?  Watch sometime, she never hides it on her face at all.  It’s like she is physically hit when she walks into the room we bunker in.”
Solide lifted one knee and rested his hand on it.  “Yeah, she seems like she feels the fields far more than we do.  She also shows predictive power, loosely like the three of us, but not exactly even to Kalco’s level.”
Crossing his arms, Railine waited a moment, thinking about it.  “Careful about our words here.  Is what we see ‘predictive’?  I say it’s not.  Maybe for her it’s Psionics?  We aren’t dealing with them ourselves, but that doesn’t mean she isn’t.”
“Fuck.  That’s a good point.  M, makes sense some advanced alien would have them.”
Railine did not possess stellar Psionics to any degree, and over the loops Solide had admitted and shown some of his combat Psionics, but neither of them had anything above zero in the Chrono realm.  Now that he was thinking about it, it seemed like it was the right idea completely with Ryla.  “Yeah, think about this, she is far more ‘emergent’ in her prediction.  I, it’s always about something subtly new that she has a jump on.  She never is good at the things that always happen.  You killing Rox gets her every time.”
They both looked at Rox, and she stood there silently,.  Solide turned back. , “Not sure I get what you are saying.”
“I am speaking largely for myself, but I think you as well.  We do not predict in the true sense of the word at all.  We react.  We react to thousands of scripts with subtle deviations we have seen.  We know who is going to turn here, say something there, because we have seen it.  But…here’s one for you,” Railine thought this was a good example, “wWhenever you are on a really rare Chrono Line, you don’t know what is going to happen.  We have a guess that Kalco often reacts violently, or Ryla is pre-disposed to acting like a scared girl, but we do not know exactly what will occur.”
Solide’s head move in affirmation.  “Got it.  I think about it from a combat view.  Y, you don’t have any combat Senses to any large degree, but you are a very good fighter now because you have lived so many battles.  You can react well, but you would never know if I was going to shoot you, which Ryla always knows it’s coming.”
“We are both beyond that, to be clear, right?” Railine asked.  He knew they both engaged in it in loops past, for him there was not much point anymore.  Solide laughed but agreed eventually.  “That is so true with Ryla. , I could barely take her down;, she definitely ‘knew’ when I was coming at her.  Disturbing.”
“Star Priestesses are the same way.  That’s why they are allowed to wiggle their asses around all that alien scum because they actually foresee when they are typically attacked and can avoid it.”
“Having a power like that would be nice.”
Solide put the question to him, “Say you are right and Ryla is using Senses but isn’t perceiving the loop, what does it matter?”
“It matters because it is good for us,” Railine explained,.  “I thought about this very early when I realized I was looping.  Everyone acted exactly the same;, I was the only one changing things.  So I thought.  Things started changing, and I figured it meant other’s were waking up to what was happening.  Mostly it was you.  I, in that regard I’m not sure if it’s fortunate or unfortunate we were paired together.”
“I remember that, back when I saw you writing on your hand.,  I thought ‘holy shit, this guy is suffering the same thing’.”  Solide had a mournful look on his face. , “Damn, what was the first one I saw on your, ‘four’ or something like that?  Holy shit.”
“Which is also why, outside of our intervention, the other group always resulted in the same outcome every time.”
Solide agreed,.  “Which was why the Chrono Line developed mostly the same every time if we allowed them to leave with two major exceptions.  All four of them left, Zaier got hit and infected at the ship, Kalco and Madigan left to the ruins.  Madigan gets lost in them, I assume he dies but I never actually make it through myself so can’t say.  Kalco gets Grav-Beaconed back to the alien ship, shoots his little girlfriend Feyria, and at that point is where things change.  Kalco would come back to the base, and he either sees me, or he sees the others.  If he only sees me, he leaves, goes to 7, not sure what happens but comes back with an Axl weapon and usually is raring for a fight and guns down whoever is left.  If he sees a group and not just me, the fight happens then,; because Laina is either dead, Rox is dead, or no one trusts him that he is the only one left.”
Railine was slowly nodding. , “The only thing you didn’t included, is in the first branch, where he leaves and if Aria is alive, she leaves typically to the ship where she kills True Form Zaier.”
“Why does that matter?  That fuck tries to run with the ship, but it never starts fast enough for when the reactor blows.”
Railine didn’t have an answer for him, but it vaguely felt like there was something important about that minor plot.  “What about the other six?”
“Rox doesn’t count, she can’t effect the Fate Line and will only fuck around with the Chrono Lines when they end, and not in a meaningful way.”
Rox finally interjected, “You make me sound so bad…”
Railine accounted for the next group, “Both Laina and Zaier, given their MalAxl affinity, apparently don’t have whatever awareness we possess.  Even when they are not infected, I never see anything novel out of them.  God…sounds so bad to be saying that about a person.”
Solide laughed,.  “When you relive the same fucking day over and over you see how puppet-like everyone is.”
“Feyria is sympathetic to them,; not sure if that has any effect but she also can’t process this.  Madigan likely is on our side, but nothing out of him either.  Guess it adds some serious credence to being subtly spiritual aware.”  Railine laughed at a joke no one else would understand about if Madigan had any clue what was happening.
“Well, can he use an Axl weapon or not?”  Solide cut to the heart of the matter.
Railine shook his head. , “Don’t know.  I give that weapon to him nearly every time, but I don’t think he has ever tried to even fire it.  These things increasingly bind with us, so given enough time maybe he could use it, but that’s assuming it survives the back fracture and it’s not entirely chronological based.”
“And what of your little fuck toy Aria?”
“Well, the facts are clear, but the conclusion is not.  She definitely doesn’t perceive the time fracture.  Yet, she can use Axl weapons almost as good as either of us.  I don’t get that at all.”
“There is a reason~!”  Rox sang from her corner.
Solide did his dismissing motion again.  “But you can’t tell us, because if we remember it will fuck up Fate.  I got it.”  She frowned again and was silent.
Railine was confused himself, and shared the sentiment.  “I don’t get it.”
“Me neither.  Being a combat android, I don’t imagine she would be able to use Axl weapons as it resonates with Life energy, not an artificial life form.”
“Well, most androids are heavily biologic.  I, it just makes me confused why she would be able to.  I suppose I don’t know enough about their creation at all one way or another.”
“I know a little,” Solide said.  “Most are created, the biologic grown and integrated with the artificial parts.  Some are recycles, we had a lot of that for Classed Soldier’s that was loosely ‘killed’ but could be later saved and turned into Androids.”
“Are they still them?”  Railine asked.  It brought him back to asking people about the Thessus ship and whose’s axe it was.
“They claim so.  C, could they ever really claim they weren’t?  I was always weirded out by them so I stayed away.”
Railine looked down,.  “That’s why so many of them self ostracize.”
“Anyway that’s good for us.  She is a gun we can use for the Axl weapons, and we don’t have to worry about her fucking up any of the Lines through her own awakening.”
Railine did not like the dismissive nature of it, but he had to agree from their current point of view.  “The problem is somewhat simply stated, but how to make it work, I have no idea.  Do you know what fires  everyone else here?”  Solide didn’t answer.  “Do you?”
“Most of them.  I was just thinking about how for so long my over riding purpose was to just kill.  If I could kill enough my value would be proven.  I think I killed enough True Forms to last me a life time.”
Solide was not emotional, but that might be as close as it normally gets, and Railine agreed. “Same with me.  I wanted to save people, and for so many loops I would torch, rocket, destroy True Form after True Form, which is deeply impressive for just a Solarian.  It might have quieted that part of my heart, but now I have a new goal.”
“Remember you mentioned to me once that this was Purgatory?  Think that’s real?”
Railine looked at Rox, an Aeon for all intents of the word.  He was not Gnostic but knew some of the religion and it seemed eerily accurate in some ways but not others.  “I don’t know.  But the two of us were able to conquer our demons due to being aware and stuck in these loops and realized how perhaps pointless it was.  The others around us don’t have that benefit, and those subconscious drives are likely very important to them.”
“Okay, so what the fuck do we do?  Laina devoted her whole life to medicine because she let a few a people die.  Seems stupid as shit to me, given how many I’ve seen die.”
“Stop, that is her mind, not yours.  You solved yours with violence, she like thinks that was stupid.”
Solide wasn’t pleased. , “She wants to save someone truly on the brink of death…that doesn’t sound conducive to successfully getting out of a loop .”
Railine had closed his eyes, massaging them slowly,.  “No, it’s not.  Zaier needs to learn to trust people again, and if he could get saved by her it would be perfect.”  The irony that Railine was considering the manipulation of people’s fates was not lost on him.  “Except they are in different groups and in no loop does changing the group ever work out well.”
“Does anyone over there even know anything about healing?  What a bad oversight out of Zaier, one of the few ones I’m aware of .”
“Yeah, it’s not good for us.”  Railing thought for a moment,.  “Feyria knows a little.”
“So what, she patches up a cut and Mr. Icy Leader loves the fucking world again?”
“It’s problematic.”
“Madigan is fucking useless around womean, and that’s probably when needs to go about him.”
Railine was not that familiar with the away group, as Solide went down with them in far more.  But apparently there was at least one True Form, and Kalco alone was not enough to stop it,; Zaier always got hit, or Madigan got killed.  “It’s eExtremely amplified by Feyria being there.  She acts out because she is actually lonely.”
Solide said sarcastically, “Wow, you should have been a psychologist instead.”
Railine looked back at him, sincerely saying, “You know, I know a lot more about people now.  I just might.”  He went on with his point.
  “Feyria secretly thinks she is not actually that valuable.  You see it a lot with the beautiful, talented types, they worry that it’s all a charade they maintain.  Don’t roll your eyes, I actually got this out of her a few times.”
“Yet you didn’t put anything in her…”
Railine didn’t bite the hook. , “Kalco is the same, he wants to actually be the hero he is worried he is not after being the ‘sole survivor’ of the thing you two went through.  So you seriously don’t think you should tell him you were the other guy there?”
“Not sure.” Solide looked over at Rox,.  “I am sure it fucks up his Fate pretty bad if I tell him on the Line we get out, right?”
She lifted both hands in a huge ‘I don’t know’.
“If they could successfully fight their way through, that would knock out three of them.  Uhh…Madigan can’t fight at all with Feyria around, and that squad is so under-gunned going in there to begin with…”
“Yeah it’s a problem.  Who’s left for us to play God for?”
Railine chided him,.  “Careful with your words.  I can’t say that is not what we are doing.  Especially with your girlfriend LineGod over there.”
She had an innocent smile on.
“I’ll answer my own question: iIt’s your little toy robot girl, and unbreakable Ryla.  Heh…”
“I normally would ask if you meant that sexually, but I know you did.”  Railine took breathed a heavy sigh.  “I unfortunately don’t have a clue about either of them.  Ryla has clearly been playing us.  I have a feeling we probably know ‘more’ than her, but whatever her agenda is, she has stuck by it.  Aria…I have no idea.”
Solide stood up, walked over, and clapped the large shoulder pauldrons on Railine’s armor.  “Here is where I get to be the hero there, buddy.  Did you know Aria has an unnatural attachment to her rifle?  Randomly in anger I took it from her once and she had a complete mental breakdown.  Like full her shit stopped as she blankly stared into space.”
“Her programming?”  Railine asked.  Aria seemed so much more Solarian than machine though.
“Don’t think so.  Androids have solid programming.  Something with her human side.”
“Wait…if that’s right, the only reason she would have that, is if she was what you called a recycle.  Maybe it was related to her past.”
Solide elucidated further, “And Zaier is related to it.  Ever wonder why she goes out in some loops?  Seems so strange for her, but she goes and talks with Zaier, then kills him.  He has a necklace, and a few times I asked him, and very reluctantly got out that it was from an old friend.”
“Estranged lovers?”
“Maybe.  Maybe you haven’t been the first one to explore some hidden depths on those nice legs of her’s…”
Railine had been around enough crude guys, it didn’t aeffect him.  “Did she act like she knew him, and vice versa?”  
Solide had backed up at this point to a comfortable distance. , “No.  I think she recognized him, maybe saw her necklace, but he doesn’t know her.  Much to her chagrin, it appears.”
“Hmm…an effect of the True Form harmonization?”
“Guess we need to figure that out, and play match maker too, what the fuck.”  Solide didn’t seem that opposed though.
“If the problems were only so easily abated, as they are part of different groups.  That brings up an interesting aside,”
“ ‘Aside’,” Solide imitated, “why do you even talk like that?”
Railine ignored him.  “We know deviating from the two group idea never seems to work, but is that because the original Chrono Line was somehow the most ideal one?  Or maybe regardless of its ideal nature, being first gave it some sort of quality we can’t understand?”
Solide did not engage. , “That is way beyond me.  Little Rox over there probably can’t tell us either.”
Railine looked at her.  S, she was laughing softly as the dogs had knocked her over and there was a big wreslting wrestling match occurring.
“Hmm, suppose at this point there is no way to know.”
“Last that cutie Ryla, no idea about her.”  He smiled darkly. , “I hate unattainable women like that.”
“The oOnly clue is she abhors violence, or the act she portrays anyway.”
Solide recalled many times he had been killed by her. , “I think it’s sincere on some level.  She will act out, and ripped me apart a few times, but I think she truly believes that.  I don’t know, would it work if we somehow don’t kill enough, or how about when they start attacking and let her dodge around until they kill each other?”
Railine didn’t like it completely,.  “You know how many loops that might take?  I wonder if you are right though.  Is there a way to show her that her non-violence works?”
Solide snickered. , “Violence always worked for me.”
“I am sure it has.”  In an irony, Railine was one of the most combat-capable Solarians around by virtue of doing combat with an elite threat thousands upon thousands of times in the most realistic ‘simulator’ imaginable.  Like Solide said, he did not have any Combat Psionic giving him an advanced warning, but he did have his instincts honed and the understanding of what his body could do, and the damage that could be done through a variety of weapons he had come to wield.
“Rox, I have a question for you,” Railine said to her.
“Yeah?”  She was laughing while the dogs were battling trying to lick her face.
“I am operating under the assumption you can loosely read my mind, if not outright, so I have a wariness towards you I am sure you know.  With that being said, my question is, are you Solide’s, so to say, or is Solide ‘yours’?  I hope you understand what I am getting at, because while we are friendly towards each other, it is not the same level I see the two of you at.”
She stood up. , “Okay, lay down, be good boys.,”  Tthe dogs calmed down while she walked back to the two men.  “It’s nuanced, but certain active elements are traditionally paired with elements such as myself.  The metaphor of him being the body, and mye being the mind is somewhat appropriate.  He acts in ways I physically can not, and I know things he can not.”
Railine kept looking at her,.  “I pieced most of that together.  But why am I here?  I have enough awareness or Axl harmonics or whatever the qualification is, arguably higher than Solide’s.  So why are you not my pair?”
“Jealous of my main squeeze there, buddy?”  Solide said teased but did not press the point.
Railine did not break his gaze.,  “I am serious.  I am misunderstanding something?”
Rox had a deep grin on. , “You may want to strangle me, but that is a good question.  I don’t know myself, and that isn’t a Fate-protecting act either.  This entire thing is abnormal in a few ways.  One is that rarely are LineGods even allowed to physically exist for a length of time, which I obviously had before this occurred.  Often not many people can see or perceive us, which is useful for keeping the magnitude of change we cause minimal.”
Railine was surprised she was forward with her information for once, but perhaps it was mostly of things she didn’t know.  Continuing, “The long and short answer, is as someone becomes more harmonized, it increases the likelihood of a LineGod manifesting to complete the pairing.  Biologically, it’s a bit similar to a single thought growing in strength until it is eventually acted out.  Solarians, or Daijins that start accumulating or Binding with Line items usually triggers this.  All this being said, the real question is two fold, you should have a LineGod pair happening. , I am surprised you don’t.  Further, Aria should as well.”
“Aria!?”  Solide was surprised.
Railine looked to him for a moment, unsure if he had explained it in this timeline or sometime in the past,.  “She supposedly had an Axl potential even higher than ours. , I forgot after she was killed what it dropped to, but it’s still really high, all things considered.”
The strange thing regarding her, was that she certainly was able to use Line weapons easily, proving Rox’s point about her Axl levels.  B, but something key had been lost when she initially died and was resurrected as a ‘recycle’ android, because there seemed to be no evidence she could process the loop.
“How do I know when or who mine might be?”
“Maybe someone in your past perhaps?”  Rox suggested.
Railine instantly thought to his psychic friend who had saved his life from that small landslide when they were younger.  His mind also went to his sister, but it didn’t seem on an intuitive level that that was the right answer.  His friend though seemed to be calling him.
It made so much sense;, she had saved him because as a LineGod she knew the Fate and Chrono outcomes and why, for some reason, he had to live.  Even her presence in his mind kept him sane in all these repetitions with the thoughts of Psionics and trying to understand if he was having one express itself.
Railine looked to Rox,; the difference in persona made sense too.  Rox was too wild, too forward to truly be his ‘type’.  Rox had mentioned at some point about their personalities are high level reflections of what their target would bond to the best.  Arguably that was a high order of manipulation occurring, but one the target would never see lost in their own reflected desire.  
Knowing this, it was a bit too personal seeing what was apparently Solide’s ‘ideal partner’.  Rox insisted that many were playful, given a subconscious hope of the target that the world was not as cynical and dark as it likely seemed, but was not always the case.  Sometimes there were ‘young’ LineGods, or mature, or cold or any variety.  Railine’s old girlfriend seemed good in many ways.  S, she had a hint of playfulness in her, while being much more even-headed and demonstrated a philosophical bent he thought was important.
They stood in silence for a while.  This loop’s time was almost over.  The reactor melting down started causing cellular damage at this point and really there wasn’t much to do.  The information was use enough.
A dark thought crossed Railine’s mind. , “Here’s where it gets complicated for us.  Are we sure it’s the reactor?  Because I am not. , I have kept that thing going for seven more cycles, and somehow still woke up here again – it never blew up as far as I knew.  Further, let’s say it is, what if we pass that event, and someone is dead.  Is it too bad for them?  What if it’s me or you who dies the time the reactor is saved?  Do we only go for it, when everyone is alive, and Zaier and Laina did not resonate with the MalAxls?”
“What are you saying?”
“I am saying, what if tragically, we have to start killing people to try to insure the loop resets and we don’t accidentally luck our way out of the loop with our friends dead?”
“Fuck.,”  Solide closed his eyes, thinking about the point. , “Iit’s never easy, is it?”
“If it was, we wouldn’t be here somewhere beyond 17,000 tries, and having your LineGod friend smile at us the whole time as we try to figure this out.”
“I just want out of this shit.  I, if one of them dies, I don’t care.”
“I don’t believe you,” Railine said.
“Well, I guess we will fucking see, wdon’t we?”

Madigan
Location: Reiko-7 on initial search


Why was someone of Madigan’s future stature sent into the deepest hell on this base?  This entire planet showed what happens when dreams die.  Or maybe this was the place dreams go to die.  He knew one of the pilots over herewho were stationed over here.  T, they were in academy together.  He was just s, some acquaintance and didn’t really care what happened to him, but knowing he was dead was a reminder that Madigan just had to hold it together a little longer before he was off this shit.
Across the walls were endless gashes, bullet holes, and discharges of various energy weapons.  He recognized a lot of laser burns, and some stronger weapons as well.  Whatever happened here, it was like a war occurred and no one survived.
He was glad he was with his friend Railine, even if he was a bit off his rocker.  Solide was the only other man he respected on the base, but had recently started doubting it with some suspicious activity out of him.  As soon as they landed, playboy bitch Kalco and his little toy were about to go explore but pretty soon after Solide sent an ICS to everyone that he saw some figures out in the snow.  
It turned into some useless search, and a bunch of time was wasted while everyone else stood around some fuel barrels outside that something was burned in.  Ryla was really disturbed because you could see flesh and blood frozen to the barrels.  “‘Iit’s like the were willing to die just to try to get it open!”’.
God, people had no sense of what the hell they were saying.  Madigan understood he was crude in his language, but there were so many around him that endlessly ran their mouths about all the dead bodies, smashed up everywhere.
“I am surprised you are so quiet,” Madigan baited his friend, trying to get him to say something to take his mind off the things he was stepping over.
“What do you want me to say?”
“Anything.  You are always going on about your voodoo spirits around us and all that.  What are they telling you?”
Railine had his head down, and a grim smile that was not really like him came over it.  “What I am about to say may sound completely crazy, but the more you let me talk, the more sense it will make.  What I am going to say will blow your mind and make you question reality.”
“There’s the Railine I know.”
Railine picked his head up,.  “Just kidding, I always wanted to say something like that to you.”
Madigan was honestly disappointed, he could use some entertainment.  If he wanted to be stepping over bodies, he’d have gone into something way different.  “The spirits aren’t talking to you?”
He laughed. , “Iin a way you wouldn’t believe.  But even if I explained it, you wouldn’t get it.”
“I bet I would.”  He didn’t believe in it at all of course.  Railine was earnest, and pretty eccentric, but Madigan liked him because they got along due to both having a deep drive to succeed and prevail.
“No…pretty sure you wouldn’t.  I have to do things the hard way.”
“Must I batter their ears so that they hear with their eyes?”
“Let me guess, that’s from one of your books.”
Railine looked back at him, his eye’s seeminged more tired than he remembered.  But Madigan wasn’t a people person so didn’t think much of it.  “Some existialism.  I think you’d actually like it.  It’s kind of how you are.” 
“I already know I need to make my own fate, I don’t need books telling me that.”
“Fate works in mysterious ways.”
Madigan laughed. , “I love your pseudo-spiritual quips you have for everything.”
“What if we are not chosen by Fate, so much as it is a partnership, we acknowledge on a deeper level.”
Madigan was laughing even harder. , “I am so glad you don’t get mad when I laugh at the stuff you say.”
“Just trying to save you, Madigan.”
“The only person we can save is our self.”
“Not this time…”  He walked over to a pink thin piece of what looked like glass.  “Looks like a weapon.  Wonder what happens…,”  Hhe picked up something off the floor and hit the pane that was imbedded in the wall.  It shattered into thousands of pieces, and in another moment turned into a reddish steam that floated up and diffused away.  “Reminds me of solid state energy weapons, wouldn’t you say?”
Madigan paused for a moment, surprised his friend actually knew something like that,.  “Yeah.  The Daijin’s have a few weapons loosely like that.  I’ve seen ship combat with those before.  Energy and matter arend inter-related so it’s not that far of a stretch at all.”
Railine vaulted a hewn together bunker and he followed his friend.  He  rRegretted it almost instantly as there was a number of body parts on this side.  As Madigan watched, Railine pulled an axe out of some guy it was frozen into.  “I’ll be taking this back,” he said.
“That your ax?”  Madigan asked sarcastically.  SHe was somewhat grossed out that he could do something like that, medical people had messed up brains.
“Yeah, I’ve had it a long time.  It’s a dear friend of mine.”
Madigan almost chuckled, and simply shook his head.  “I can’t imagine you are a hit with the ladies.  Maybe that’s why we get along.”
Railine looked around. , “This place feels weird to me, don’t tell me it doesn’t to you.  Don’t you want a gun or anything?”
“Yeah, I could use one.”  He was glad for something else to look for instead of all the bodies and Daijin Star crystal panes that cleaved these people apart.  “I can’t handle this side, too disgusting.”  Madigan jumped back over and poked around.  There were a few projectile weapons, but he always favored energy weapons.  Maybe it was because he knew where the limiter was on so many of them and could really bring out their potential.
Railine was going crazy on his side, throwing stuff around and making Madigan a bit embarrassed his friend was acting with such abandon.  “Whoaoah…this has your name all over it.”
Railine jumped back and presented a black looking cannon that had a barrel sloped diagonally away.  It had the slightest of dark green trim, and appeared to be a bipedal weapon with the typical stock, trigger area, and a forward place to hold the weapon.
“Never seen one like this before.  Maybe I should try it first.,”
Railine shook his head. , “I’d wait till we get back, and you can test it properly.  We should be leaving soon.”
As if on cueall, Zaier had come into the room. , “We wasted enough time here with Solide’s shadow figures and everyone being too scared by the machinations of some idiots and a fuel barrel.  We are leaving.”
“Anyone check Gamma wing?”  Railine asked.
“Solide took Ryla to check out it, but they didn’t have much time.  Why do you ask?”
“That was where the dog’s werewould be, if they are still alive,” Railine answered.  “Rox may be sad we left them.”
“Rox will deal with it.,”  Hhe turned and walked out.
“So much for that…” Railine said under his breath.
“Whatever.  I am glad we are getting out of here.  Thanks for the weapon, I’ll have to do some digging to see what I can find out about it.”
They started walking out of the command center they were in, leaving the bodies and the darkness behind them.  “Just use it for good, alright there, buddy?  The spirits won’t let me sleep otherwise.”  Madigan almost laughed at Railine’s joke.
“Tell them you are in good hands with me.”
“Someone’s hands anyway,” Railine ended thoughtfully.

Zaier
Location: Reiko-10 center room before bunkering

The morning had almost come, and it was likely no one got any sleep, given that everyone at the base had disappeared.  Zaier had loosely taunted them to try to get some sleep, but he himself was up, pouring over alternatives to what had happened here.  Excluding the three dogs they had, which now trotted around the feet of the group assembling in the main room, it wasthere were only ten people left.  The strange thing was not that everyone was gone or likely dead – , given that Seven7 had gotten wiped out, it made sense a fate similar would befall 10Ten; – the strange thingbut that was that there was no sign of conflict here.
The reason Zaier was put on a worthless assignment like this was making a lot of sense.  Running a base was easy for someone of his intellect, but it was not a good use of his skills.  He did not miss the days of political assassinations, and preferred the leadership role he was now in, but meaningless happenings before the recent events bored him.  With survival as the stake, it was much more interesting to his cerebral character.
Unfortunately, they wasted a lot of time at Seven and did not get as much done as he had hoped before the storm forced them back.  Solide claimed his saw some figures, and they assembled to go track they down but nothing came of it.  A lot of the crew here was disturbed by the destroyed base, the desperation with pieces of evidence like the flesh on the barrels.
Back at Ten10, something had happened here as well in that everyone was gone and, the blizzard that had been raging madeke physical tracking of the other members impossible.
One oddity, was last night they were walking into the main open room when he was hanging back and happened to see Ryla.  She had her head down, her hair and ribbon blocking most of her face, and when they entered the room it looked like she staggered.  Zaier watched carefully as she lifted her head wildly, her eyes wide as she glanced around as if teleported into a war zone as a small child.  He shifted his eyes enough that she did not meet his gaze and she quickly got control of whatever emotion she was beset by.
Laina and Feyria were hanging out by Kalco who was acting larger than life still, betraying no sign of worry.  Railine leaned against the wall, holding his elbow with one hand and the other massaging his closed eyes, that axe he took from Seven7 was leaning nearby him.  Zaier didn’t feel like stopping him.
It looked like everyone was here, and was about to start talking when he realized he only counted eight8.  He glanced over everyone again, and it was that guard Solide  that was missing.
“Where is Solide?”  Zaier asked.  The chatter silenced and everyone looked around.
No one said anything.  Eventually Ryla said, “He was helping get out some weapons earlier, last I saw, so that was the weapon’s locker.”
Zaier walked the few steps to take a look inside the adjacent room, and it was clear he was not there.  Various weapons, and a few pieces of armor hung out on the floor.  No one took his warning  too seriously as of yet.  He stepped towards the other door, and looked out the window.  It was snowing pretty hard and the hangar in the distance could only occasionally be seen.  The energy field of the doorway glowed in the dawn, and from here it looked like the Gyro-Copter may have been missing. 
Zaier was about to ask Feyria about the vehicle positions, when Railine was in the doorway, asking “So, what do we do now?”
He turned to answer him, ands he caught the glimpse of some shadow figure moving behind Railine.  Solide!?
Ryla screamed and from his point of view could not see the full battle.  There were three loud shots, and Railine had his axe up, parrying whatever was attacking him and Ryla and in one decisive slash ended whatever it was.
Ryla was breathing very hard, clutching Railine’s waist while he held the axe in an easy, practiced grip in front of him.
“Uh…what the FUCK was that?”  Madigan asked.
Zaier walked over,; it was a humanoid body and with one boot he kicked the split torso over.
“Oh god…it was a girl,” Laina said.
Indeed.  The body appeared to be female in that it had breasts, a trim waist where it was cut in half, and long hair.  Part of the face even looked right, as it had a sorrowful frown and a glazed empty eye.  The other side of the face looked like it was scarred, radiation burned almost, and the arm on that side had mostly melted off, and somehow the bone had disfigured into what could be called a blade or a claw.
“Does she look familiar?”  Zaier asked.  He could have sworen there was a womean who worked in medical who looked like her.
Laina spoke up, “Yeah…she was on my team.  What happened to her?”
Zaier took a step back.,  “You are the medical expert here, you tell me.”
Laina bent down, getting ready to touch and investigate her.  Railine put a hand on her shoulder, shaking his head no. , “Might be contagious through our nanites.”
She looked back at the woman, if you could call it that, and decided discretion was better.  “Only because s he is already dead.”
“Are those Strives on its face?”  Madigan asked as he , pointed at the black marks that went up her neck, across her check, and through the eye including the eyebrow.
“Axl Lines,.”  Railine said.
“ ‘Axl’?”  Madigan turned to him.  Ryla turned as well, looking intent at the strange word.  That was odd for the young girl.
“Spirit stuff ,.  Leylines for energy that are physically manifested on the body.”
Zaier looked at Madigan, and Madigan shrugged. , “He talks about this shit all the time, it’s normal.”
Ryla put a hand on her hip. , “I never heard that term before, what does it mean?”
Railine looked at her, and without any pause,.  “Oh, I don’t know for sure.  I had a Star Priestess friend and , she told me a bit about that stuff is all.  I probably misspoke.”
Ryla did not seem satisfied, but let it go.
“I guess we know what happened to Seven7,” Rox said;, she was holding the dogs back who wanted to go smell the body.
“Who left the doors open?”  Feyria saidasked.  Zaier knew the answer, but was thinking of other things.
“The doors auto-open to our presence,” Madigan answered.
“Wow, you are really smart,” despite the sentence being factious sounding, Feyria delivered it with seriousness.
Laina was probably the second smartest here, and gratefully took the lead of talking for a while.  “Not sure if you guys noticed, but at Seven7, the vehicle bay door was slammed outwards with a pretty huge force.  We don’t know what this thing is, but if it is at all related to what happened there, I don’t think locking the door would work either.”
“The heat ,” Railine said.
Madigan spoke up. , “The reactor still hasn’t been working right, and if our base starts getting bashed up like Seven7, we could legitimately have a problem with the heat.  We may want to leave them on auto open.”
“All good with me.,”  Kalco spun his pistol and caught it while pointing at the door.  “I already got one kill already.”
“Pretty sure Railine killed it,” Laina said to her boyfriend.
“We fight them, simple,.”  Kalco said again.
“Indeed.”  Zaier did a quick assessment of the room, and this would be a good place to create a bunker of sorts.  “I want to fortify this room.  We are going to make a bunker like what I saw at Seven7 out of any excess furniture or anything.”
“It did shit for them,” Madigan said quietly.
It was clear to others that Zaier heard it,.  “They got over-ran eventually.  We know that, let me say that.  We are down to only ten of us left.  My idea is that we are going to split up, and half are staying here, while the other group goes out to look for clues.  Ryla found some new areas givingen off readings last night.”
Madigan shook his head. , “Great, either stay here and get plowed over, and end up with that axe in my back,.”  Zaier didn’t know what he meant.
Zaier looked at him coldly,.  “How fortunate for you, you are going to be part of the team that is leaving.”  Madigan had his mouth open very slightly and was biting his tongue.  He didn’t say anything else.
“Where’d that asshole guard go anyway?”  Rox had her head up and was looking around the room.
That’s right.  It brought Zaier back to that original thought.
“He told me he was going to the emergency cache,” Railine had a quick answer.
“In this weather?”  Feyria asked.
Railine held both his palms open. , “I don’t know.  I’m not his friend, ask Madigan, that’s just what he said.”
“I am not his friend,” Madigan quickly distanced himself from the man who had disappeared.
“Well it’s not that far, just but this weather…,”  Feyria looked out the window at the blowing snow outside.  The sun had just started to come up, but it was not very uplifting in the slightest.  “Maybe he got caught what everyone else did.  Just walked away into the snow.”
“He might have,” Railine said seriously .
“It got him already?”  Ryla asked worriedly.
Zaier was looking over the eight around him, deciding on what group to take.  Having Solide gone left his original plan of who to leave a bit light on the base defense.
“If I  am may request Aria and Rox to stay with me here,” Railine said to Zaier.  “The three of us should be able to hold off any small attacks, and if we have Laina and Ryla we should be okay injury wise.  If you are okay with five of us here.”
Such a suggestion was perfect from a selfish standpoint of who he preferred with himself.
Zaier knew there was a small tension between Railine and Laina, as she was hyper-competitive about her skills in medicine.  She was the best here, no doubt, but Aria, Railine, and Ryla were all loosely skilled and she had grabbed hold of the idea she really needed to let him know it.  Hearing his deference to her, Zaier saw her face soften slightly.
He was glad Railine brought it up, as that was going to be the breakdown anyway, but he was worried that without Solide here they may not have enough firepower.  B, but if they were okay with it themselves, so was he.
“So he gets all the girls?”  Kalco asked.  “I see what’s up here…”
“Almost all of them~”  Feyria said.
“Let’s build this bunker up a bit for them before we go,” Zaier said.  He doubted it would truly matter given the massacre they saw at Seven7, but it might help the morale for those they were leaving.
They all spent some time pulling various furniture, tables, couches, and a few beds and stacked them in a crude box shape in the middle.  Madigan’s words about it not helping Seven hung in Zaier’s mind a bit.  That was likely true, and really the reason why they had to try something like his small squad setting out.  Sticking around they would get killed, or possessed to walk away.  There was no proof that, if the four of them came back, the five they left behind would either still be alive, or had would not have decided to go walk away like the rest of the base and Solide.
Zaier had finished pulling a large table and placing it when Kalco came up to him.  “Railine had a good point, we should probably grab the best gear we can before we head out.”
In Zaier’s mind, things processed like simultaneous events.  There was some dark countdown occurring that for every moment wasted, the end was coming for all of them.  He imagined the waste of time having them pour through lockers and try armor on that brought them closer to the end.
“Listen up, I want us four to give a quick look over any of the weapons or stores you feel like we need.  I mean quick, and we are leaving.  I am not sure how much time we have here.”  He looked at Railine, speaking softer, “You know there is a good chance you may die here, right?”
“I am well aware that chance is close to 100%.”
Zaier smiled;, he didn’t think that Railine was that aware of his situation.  Of course he didn’t want to willingly send any of his people into death, but having one of them know the likelihood made it easier to let happen.
“You might survive,” Zaier said.
“I am doing everything I can to insure we all make it.”
What a good little peon.  Zaier never understood how others could be so sacrificial of their own life.  When Zaier died, it was over.  Because of that belief, he had little desire to stage any sort of last stand Railine seemed willing to do.  The interesting thought to him, was if the others knew he had signed them up for a likely death warrant.  Not to say his team leaving would not also meet a grisly fate, but it was quite clear the bases here were being destroyed;, at least they had a chance by leaving.  
The four of them had gone over to the weapons lockers.  Feyria and himself grabbed some light armor, as he favored movement over pure protection.  S and she grabbed a pistol of some kind and he settled on a Pulse Rifle someone had installed an inducting rail on, customizing it to a much higher power.
While the suit was adjusting to his body, he thought about the others being left behind.  Rox and Laina he could care less about, short of loosely wanting Laina’s medical skills for his own protection.  Ryla he liked, and given more time likely could be a very good leader given her multi-tasking skills, but for his own self she did not offer much.  Aria was Railine’s friend,; she reminded him of a girl he once loved in a lot of ways, but she had died.  Maybe his heart held a little latent desire that could never be fulfilled that had turned to hate, and letting the similar girl likely die was not a hard decision to allow.
Feyria bounced her head to each side a few times, threw a left hand through her hair, and pulled it all out of the combat vest she had over her jacket.  Her long soft hair fell perfectly behind her.  “We about ready?  The snow is letting up, and this is our chance to get out of here.”
Railine had popped in. , “Just wanted to say good luck, and don’t worry too much about us.”  He took a couple of steps and then started tipping forward. , “WoahWhoa!”  Railine tripped over a gun that had been left on the floor.  H, he staggered a few steps and looked like he might catch himself but fell into Feyria.  She caught him, but his hands landed on her breast, and on her hip.  He retracted his hands quickly, but showing an element of clumsiness tripped on her and both of them almost went down again while he held her almost dragging them both down.  He caught her, doing something near her waist and hauled her up to her feet.
“Hey, if you were ever this forward, maybe things might have gone somewhere.,”  She smiled deviously at him.
“Sor…sorry.  My nerves are a bit shot.  I never had to kill something before .  I’m, still replaying it in my mind over and over .”
Feyria put a hand on his shoulder., “See Ryla, this is the kind of guy you want to find for long term.  T, the silent warrior who also hesitantly opens his heart about his fears.  So cute!”
“Let’s go.,” Zaier said.  He looked down at the floor, seeingit was some black weapon Madigan brought it back from Seven7.  “Isn’t this yours?” h He asked.
“Oh yeah, never got a chance to test it.,”  Madigan bent down and grabbed it.  “Not sure how it ended up here.  I’m , not even sure it fires.”
“It does, that’s my fault. , I’ve just been stressed out,” Railine said.  “I tried it out during the night.  Works like a typical plasma cannon.  B, be careful, and only use it when you really have to.”
“Thanks.”  Madigan picked it up, looked at it briefly, and tossed it in his backpack that resized to a bigger size to hold the weapon.
“Hey.,”  Railine tapped Kalco’s shoulder while opening the door.  The cold instantly hit all of them.  Zaier was about to say something, when Railine continued, “Doesn’t that look like one of those things, out in the distance?  Might need to mag your eyes.”  He was pointing to a far hill.
Kalco squared up, and Zaier came over as well.  Zaier consciously communicated with his nanites as they overlaid a magnifying lens for his eyes, and sure enough there was another creature that from this distance looked the same.  Vaguely like themus, but with the misshapen arm and burnt face.
“Can you hit it?” the firefighter  asked
Kalco lifted his pistol.,  “It’s a bit far, might take a few.”
“I got it.”  Zaier knelt.  T, the rifle felt familiar in his hands, the scope relaying important information about wind, distance, and so on.  He squeezed the trigger as a packet of rounsd already very fast, but now magnetically boosted,  ripped from the rifle.  I, it hit the thing hard in the chest.  It staggered, and surprised Zaier that it was still moving.  A second packet sent it down.
“Feyria, go start the V-Plane and don’t look back.  P, pull it out to the runway so we can cover your escape,” Railine said to her.  She nodded and Zaier now in combat mode scanned the hill sides for more of them.  He was so glad he was getting out of here.  He had a strange respect for the illogic of Railine, but and the bravery in face of likely death.  
Feyria could move very fast, and Zaier seemed to recall she was some track or athletic champ when he was reviewing her dossier once upon a calm time ago.  She sprinted straight to the plane, and fired it up as it slid out to the runway.
“It looks like you are good now, but you need to move fast,” Railine said to Zaier.
Zaier looked back at him.,  “You’d have made a good soldier.”
“Not initially,” Railine said.  The two men looked at one another, and Zaier truly believed it would be the last time it would be while he was alive.  Zaier turned, and with a hard run along with Madigan and Kalco trotting behind in heavier armor they boarded the V-Plane as it hung right outside the hangaer.




 
Madigan
Location: Ancient Ship

You know why it was us right? – Feyria was ICSing Madigan while they were walking away from the V-Plane.  He didn’t like her for a multitude of reasons and had no interest in talking at all.  I know you are listening.  You haven’t put a block on me yet.  Madigan was about to do just that when her next words actually gave him pause.  He picked us because he wanted to survive – we were the best.
Of course Madigan would label himself the best in a few things,; in terms of flying and repairing there was no one here that could compare, those though the promiscuous woman talking to him would likely argue that point.  He looked across the icy landscape at the V-Plane sitting silently near them.  They had landed and were following what looked like a trail into this a tunnel on the top of a mountain.  Reluctantly he responded in the bare minimum that would keep her talking.
What do you mean?
Do I have to repeat myself? – Sshe asked.  She was walking in front of him, and did not turn around.  ICS was weird like that;, people forgot what talking to someone meant.  He looked up at her, her ass shiftinged back and forth in the tight winter clothes with walking regularity.  On one side he could appreciate the artistic beauty her body represented.  Pilots of course were AGEd to high degrees already, so things like facial symmetry and the like were already locked in, but she was athletic which really helped her appearance and feminine charm.  That was a part of something he could easily dismiss in his mind though, she reminded him too much of the girls that scarred him.
One thing was for sure, he was not going to argue with this bitch.  He went to block her ICS and was at the FEYRIA>ACTIONS in the menu in his mind when she was lucky a second time and restarted her conversation.
You were at Seven7, you saw what happened there. – Feyria
Of course he was there, for some fucked up reason he was with Railine in the deepest part where the bodies were stacked the highest.  Where should he start?  With the axe Railine took that was stuck in some guy?  The hands and arms dismembered everywhere?  The solid state energy weapons?
He bent down to look at a particularly obvious boot print in the snow that had drifted in the hallway they had entered - definitely Solarian, no animal or anything.  Not like anything lived here.  Madigan tried to remember if that creature they killed had feet, or what was on the bottom but could not.
Another thing he could not stand about Feyria was her avatar.  Any message he got from her, he closed it as fast as he could.  Most people did not change their avatars as it was actually a lot of work given the normal way they were: that of a cartoonish version of the person with a bigger head, almost the size of their shrunk body.  It was like a comic or something, and the reason being it showed the facial expressions, exaggerated as the person might make them, easier to see.  It was from the Aelisha, and you could blame them,; Madigan did.
He hated watching her little avatar dance back and forth with a rhythm and her hair flowing down the back while she was looking at ‘you’ with a hunger in her eyes.
Of course I saw what happened there. – Madigan
Good!  I thought I lost you. – She was smart enough to know even local ICS transmitters could communicate over a short distance like this without any sort of booster or relay like a vehicle, base, or satellite.  Aren’t you happy you are one of the fortunate ones?  Oh wait, you think you deserve this, don’t you?
You bitch!
We are both ‘Pilots’ so of course we have some vanity to us, but your arrogance is palpable. – Feyria
And what the fuck do you think you are?  You slut around with every guy you can, wagging your ass and bragging about how good of a pilot you are!
In front of them Zaier waved them down a corner.  It was pretty obvious they were in a structure at this point.  Madigan only wanted to smash the face of this girl in front of him though.
My dear Madigan, her avatar was wagging a finger at him this shows your bias.  Have I ever once bragged about my piloting skills?  Further, I flirt with guys and you jump to conclusions.  I am only having fun.  Not only is it normal to begin with to have sex, but for your prudish mind you may consol yourself knowing it is far less for me than the act I play up.
I don’t give a fuck how you rationalize it.  All whores do.  We both know I am the better pilot.
Ohhh!  We are getting somewhere.  Unlike you, I actually take time to know people, and I know you have a competitive spirit.  Feel like actually racing? – Feyria
I’d smash you. – Madigan.
Oh, so you DO want me?  His rage started growing from her coyness before she continued, You’re predictable.  That will get you in trouble.
She was younger, more naïve, and in all ways inferior to him.  He did not need anything close to a lecture out of her.
I’ll race you, and the only prize I want is for you to shut the hell up. – Madigan
Perfect!  You ride Lift Bikes?  I’d say a Jet Cycle but you don’t seem the type.
At this point Madigan was aware of his armor being a bit tight around his neck.  He slipped his glove under and pulled slightly, the armor correctly interpretinged this to loosen somewhat and readjust.  Having armor on, and the energy rifle he was carrying seemed excessive.  He also didn’t see any chance to test the Reiko-7 weapon Railine gave him.
I’ve rode Jet Cycles, but I prefer Lift Bikes with sport mode on. - Madigan
If I win, I want you to tell me why you hate women so bad.  I want to understand you. – Feyria.  In front of him she was looking up at the ceiling, and then turned to look at some consoles.  Below them a low fog hung by their feet.  It smelled a bit like explosives here.
I don’t want you to understand me.
She laughed divisively in real life.  How cute.  So childish.  Let me guess, I need to let you borrow a bike?
I got a customized bike in storage I will destroy you with. - Madigan
Really?  I have this cool one with this pink, black, and orange color scheme.  I assume you’ve upgraded your grav plates? – Feyria
Of course, stock sucks way too much if you want to go fast.  You really need better replusors repulsors if you are going to get anywhere.
I know!  Those were the first things I threw out.  – Feyria
She started innocently laughing in real life and Madigan himself chuckled for a moment.  He realized what he was doing and, stopped himself cold.
“Well, seems like we are in a ship to me, given there was a set of foot prints in here.  W, wonder where our friend went?”  Kalco asked, his pistol was out and he was spinning it like he normally did.  
“The controls are far different, but this definitely seems like a control room,”  Madigan answered.
“No windows, how could they fly?” Kalco  He asked.
“Most ships actually look like this when they aren’t powered on, it just relays the outside in.  See the wall?”  He pointed to where it was flat.  “Could guarantee that this is probably where the ‘outside’ is viewed.”
“Can we start it?”  Zaier asked.  He came over and pointed at a button.
“If you know the right combination.  The V-Plane isn’t that complicated, you just need to know the small combination off the start.”
“ ‘A million monkeys on a million typewriters…’” he Zaier said to himself as he squared up and started hitting a few random buttons.  It only took one try for something to start happening.
Madigan did not expect anything to happen, but when thereir was a musical tone like percussion bells and blue lights spiraled around the consoles as the room took on a small light, he was shook.  “What the hell did you do?”
“I think he turned it on,.”  Feyria looked up and there were some holographic screens that had come on, the symbols were nothing like anyone had seen.  Everything still looked in very low power, like some sort of standby.
“Did it really only take one lucky button press?”  Madigan asked.  T, the only other person that might know would be Feyria but it was mostly rhetorical.  It was not unheard of, after all Lift Bikes only had one button to start.  But there was a difference he thought between a small Lift-Bike and a large ship.  Maybe it had been set up for them.
“I see something glowing over here,” Feyria said as she poked into the next room.
Heim and Kalco followed.  The room was more misty, and the smell of explosives were stronger.  He felt wary being here.  A few moments later, Zaier followed.
“Hey, some light in the corner,.”  Kalco walked over.  I, it was like a little lantern that had a dull sky blue glow to it.
“A radioactive,” Madigan explained, “probably mostly decayed but you could use it for light for a long time.”
“Is something else glowing?”  Feyria asked.
He looked at her, and was trying to not be distracted by both the fact she was very attractive, mixed with an intense feeling of disgust towards her with the slightest burgeoning of respect perhaps.
“Oh shit…shit…!”  Kalco staggered back a few steps.
Behind Feyria who was looking at him, a figure had phased through the wall.  It looked angelic as much as he was also sure it was going to kill him.  It hovered in the air, and had this long soft hair and a slightly elfish face.  Behind it were loosely ‘wings’ that were not connected and looked like huge daggers or sharp triangles that pointed down in a menacing and inhuman style.  With the creature staring at him, he could not move.  He felt like his destruction was correct, and was sorry for living.  
Kalco reacted fairly well and started shooting at it.  Madigan snapped out of it when it wasn’t facing him anymore.  The distraction was enough, that whatever attack was aimed at him or Feyria was put slightly off target.  “Look out!”  He stepped forward, stiff arming her hard to the ground as in between them some large pink pane of energy slashed between the two of them.  It cleaved right through a section of his armor.
He turned, and lifted up the rifle Railine gave him up.  At this point Kalco had stopped firing.  The creature raised its hand, and whatever was going to occur would not be good for Kalco as that attack narrowly missed Madigan or Feyria only due to a distraction.
The green energy bars on the rifle accelerated faster and faster, and as he pulled the trigger a long beam of green light lanced out.  It hit the creature but also most of it went seemed to just go right through.  He did not think about it long before he changed, so much as  changing the discharge to maximum and fireding again.
A long lance of bright green shot out, and it was like a soft snowing of green dust underneath it, likely matter in the air being destroyed.  It hit the creature in the head, and he pulled the trigger again, the rifle warning that over-heat was imminent.  
The third shot in a very narrow time frame did something strange to the creature.  It picked its head up and, turned to Madigan who’se heart dropped out of his chest.  There was a loud, piercing scream as red fractures appeared in the creature.  The very next moment the creature disappeared, exploded into a mini snow globe of sparkling energy to that floated upwards for a few moments and disappeared.
Madigan was breathing hard.  “Holy fuck…”  Feyria had clambered up, and had put one arm around Madigan, her other hand holding her pistol and a pistol out in the other.  “Are you okay ?”  She nodded, and let go of him.
“What was that?”  Zaier asked.  H, he crept forward, his rifle held ready.
Kalco had his pistol out and walked towards the other three, he washis breathing just as hard.  “A True Form .”  He paused a moment. , “We are so lucky to be alive right now.”
“A True Form?”
“That’s what they are actually called.  It’s an upper dimensional creature.  I’ve encountered them once.  T, they can wipe out entire elite squads easy.”
Madigan felt elated they somehow beat it.  He somehow beat it.  All with the distraction of Feyria in his mind, and despite his latent hate he actually saved her for some reason.
Kalco looked somewhat conflicted. , “It must have been wounded or something.  No one knows much about them, but maybe it was a baby, or weak.  They never go down that easy, from the few I have seen.”
“We had help from on high…”  Zaier’s words were dismissive.
Kalco nodded yes quiet fervently,.  “Naturally.”
Madigan looked down at his armor, taking his glove off to feel the deep gap through the advanced material.  That weapon  was the same they saw at Seven7.  He looked at it imbedded in the ground only a few steps away.  If it had cut through his armor that easilyy, him or Feyria would be severely wounded.
You saved me. – Feyria.  He looked up and saw her looking at him.  Her typical arrogance or flirty behavior was replaced by a warm but serious look on her face.
Yeah…I don’t know what happened.
Thank you. – Feyria smiled at him softly.  It felt like it was one of the few sincere moments he had ever had with her.  Something stirred deep in his heart.  
“You’re welcome,” he said, turning away from her .













 
Laina
Location: Reiko-10, Bunkered Room

“Well I guess I can let the dogs out again,” Rox said as she disappeared and a few moments later the three dogs were playfully hopping around between the group looking to get pet.
Laina watched as the V-Plane went out of sight in the snow storm.  It was only five of them remaining on Reiko-10.  She had overheard some of Zaier and Railine talking and for the first time it was loosely chipping at the edge of her consciousness that she was left to die.  She did not understand either, given her medical knowledge;, one would think she would be important to take.
There was a dog by her hand, nudging her.  She thoughtlessly rubbed its ear a bit thinking they too were stuck here.
For all intents Reiko-7 was the same base in terms of equipment, personnel, and so on.  She was among the first in there and she saw how bad they had been destroyed.  Panic explained perhaps some of the murders that looked like people turning on each other, but the vast amounts of burning, and dismembered bodies left a large gulf in the explanation of what had happened.
The four around her were silent for their own reasons.  It was nothing odd for Aria, but Ryla was clearly scared.  She was ans assistant to Zaier and being left behind likely damaged her ego, realizing she wasn’t that useful when it was survival time.  Rox and Railine were two interesting cases and they had a wide range of general skills, but in more of a maintenance sort of way which striking out evidently did not need equal need into Zaier’s mind.
But why was she left?  That stung her a bit as well.  Ryla was delusional if she thought there was any reason to bring her, but Laina possessed a solid intellect and undisputed medical knowledge.  In fact, in retrospect it seemed an oversight of Zaier to not have anyone practically medically skilled at all with him.  Feyria had a passing knowledge but that was it.  
It was frustrating that Kalco did not protest being separated either.  Laina might be giving into a bit of cataclysmic thinking, considering options of them getting killed here, but Reiko-7 stood as a stark reminder they were dealing with something serious.  
“Well,” Rox came over, putting her arm on Laina and her other on Railine.  , and “Look’s like he left all the fun people here.  Isn’t there some metaphor about all the fun people being the ones that end up in hell?”
“I am not worried,” Railine said, picking his head up from the ground he was looking at.  Laina had gracefully took Rox’s arm off her shoulder and stepped away.
“It’s been a long time since we were all together like this, ya know?”  Rox said.
Laina was self aware enough to know she possessed a moderate level of envy for some women, and Rox was not one of them.  Feyria had such soft skin and her hair was so long that it triggered her envy seeing her on every male around here including Kalco; but Rox’s crudeness did little to make anything close to jealousy happen in her mind.  She might be attractive if she combed her hair at all and didn’t swear and in general act somewhat like a man.
“Fate is with us, perhaps,.”  Railine said.  Laina didn’t think much of Railine’s comment as he often spouted off about stuff like that,; they had enough subtle tension given a overlapping job.
Rox closed one eye whyile she slyly poked Railine in the chest.,  “Fate is with you, big guy, look at all these lovely ladies all to yourself.”
That’s true.  Laina realized that Railine was indeed the only male here.  Solide was supposedly at the emergency cache, but given what happened with everyone else here he had probably marched off to his death in the snow.  In contrast, Zaier’s party was pure male excluding Feyria the dominate pilot.  
“You going to be able to handle a bunch of girls like us?”  Laina asked him.
“Were we left to die?”  Ryla looked around at the others.
Railine answered Ryla, while including ignoring Laina’s question.  “We may have been.  But we are not going to die.  I will do everything I can to protect you, and we have some very skilled people here with us.  Aria and Rox can fight extremely well, and Laina and myself can hold our own.  You are selling yourself too short,.  I have a feeling you might be able to help us out in combat, even if you don’t want to fight.”
“That…was well said,” Laina had to admit.  She was actually surprised by him giving her any accolades.  When the chips were done, perhaps he was not as bad of a guy as she originally thought.
“We are going to be attacked more?”  Ryla asked from his implication.
“Way more.  Did you actually make in into 7Seven at all?”  She nodded.  “They were our sister base, and they got massacred.  The advantage is we know it is coming.  We have seen this before…”
“You can say that again!”  Rox loudly chirped.
“…and we should do everything we can to prepare.  I recommend any armor and weapon you feel comnfortable with.  Take any of the higher end stuff, Zaier either isn’t coming back, or if he is…” Railine just abandoned the thought,.  “Take whatever you want.”
Laina vastly preferred her Nano-Blade and would stick with that as it served her general style quite well of finesse mixed with biological knowledge.  Having some armor would be a good idea.  “We should get all the medical stuff out too.  I, if our job is just to survive, we can do that against some heavy odds if we get ready now.”
“How so?”  Ryla asked her.
Laina ran through some things in her mind, including that she was ready to pay Railine a compliment since he had broken the ice first.  “I’d prefer if you two carried advanced Medi-kits with you,” she said pointing to him and Aria.  She turned to the other two females. , “Both of you have had some medical training right?  I’ve seen you at a few classes I have put on here.”
“Hell yeah,” Rox said. , “I always prefer just heating up that knife and cauterizing the wounds myself.”
Laina was not sure if she was serious.  “Yes, well, if you two would have the small Medi-kits on you.  I think we got a Res Kit in storage somewhere, let’s bring that out into this middle area.  Everyone has their ReNew Paks right?”
“We are always supposed to,” Ryla said.
“I am just checking, it would be bad to have need it and not need have it.”
“I actually lost mine this morning,” Railine said.
The others looked at him in disbelief.  T, they were very valuable, and to lose one would be a pretty big deal normally.  “I think we got a couple in the medical storage, grab one.  Get all the blood paks together also.”
“Something’s coming.,”  Ryla pointed down Delta wing.  A few moments later the three dogs that were hanging around all turned towards the door and started growling.
Railine and Laina both choked up on their melee weapons, and Aria knelt down bringing her rifle to bear.  A figure moved at them, and Aria hit it very fast, and impressedimpressing Laina with her marksmanship.  It hit right above the heart, near where its disfigured arm started.  The large caliber rifle seemed sufficient as it dropped it in a single hit.
“I need to finish it off,” Railine stated, trotting towards it.
“What?  It’s dead.”
“Sometimes they come back,” Railine said.  It seemed like a pointless fight as he went over and cleaved the body into a few pieces with his axe.  Ryla had not watched.
“Well hot damn girls and boy, I guess I better get a weapon for this party ,” Rox said.  “Aria, do you want to help Ryla get some stuff on, or me?”
“You,” she said.
Railine came back into the main room,.  “If they come one at a time, we are fine, but they won’t.  They are probably intelligent and will learn.”  Laina was about to ask him how he knew any of this, but he turned and said to her, “The things I saw at the command center at Seven7 was…really bad.  I shouldn’t talk about it.,”  Hhe gave a quick thumb over to Ryla who was walking away with Rox.  That was a good explanation for his behavior and she let it go.  “Can you think of anything else we can do that will help us…at all?”
She thought for a moment, and there was.  “Hold up,” Laina said, the other two stopped.  “There’s…something else we can do too.”
“What is it?” the The young woman Ryla asked.  Her face betrayed such naïve optimism at the world still.
The words were easy to say, but the implications were larger given their likely permanence.
“Well?  I am feeling awfully naked over here.,”  Rox turned to Railine,.  “But hey, if you want to see me actually naked you just have to ask instead of having your bathroom fantasies alone in the shower.”  Railine’s face remained stone.
Laina gave them the answer.  “I know we have a few neural chips in storage, I think Madigan had a few over in Supply as well.  There are a few implants we could probably re-purpose as well.”
“Aren’t Neural chips…permanent?”  Ryla asked.
Laina turned to her, owning the suggestion,.  “Yes they are.  They integrate with your brain to such a level that they practically they cannot be removed.  For what it’s worth, you can upgrade to better versions.”
“Hot damn, I knew this was the party squad here.  Already talking about implants and body modification and we hardly even know each other.,”  Rox was holding one hand over her chest. , “Hhow will they help?  I don’t feel inadequate.  But if it helps, I guess I’ll take the largest you got!”
Ryla shook her head. , “No, not those kinds of implants, I assume she means variations of cybernetic…”  Rox came over, interrupting and rustlinged Ryla’s hair.  “Hey!”
“I knew that, you are still young so I will let that go.,”  Rox smiled at the other three around her.
“There’s a pretty big time lag on those, right?”  Railine asked her.
Laina nodded.  “The Neural chip is a pretty simple ‘surgery’ if you even want to call a simple skull insertion such, but it’d take probably about half of the morning to get used to it.”
“And what about any of the implants?  What do we have to work with?”
Laina thought about it for a moment.  “Depends what I can find.  A lot of these were meant for someone getting dismembered and having something reattached until they make it to a better facility in Affiliated space.”  Laina rocked her head to each side a bit as she was counting mentally.  “Got a few, got some spinal inserts, could make something work with some substrates for your legs, think there’s some arm implants. , I knew I got a mechanical heart valve overhaul if anyone is feeling especially brave.”
“Not interested ,” Aria said.
Railine turned back to Laina. , “I may be, what would the heart thing involve and do?”
Laina sighed crossing her arms, with her left hand up by her cheek, thinking of the process.  “They are mainly for if someone’s heart gets destroyed and we can slap one in fast enough.  Well, you would have to be under first of all…”  Sshe rocked her head some more.  “I could do it no question, but…”
“What does it do for me?”  Railine asked firmly.
“It’s stop you from bleeding out as easily, that’ is for sure.  They would be able to regulate conditions of low blood volume much better than just nanites.  Did you know a lot of combat androids have similar things?  The ones we have, I could make work probably better given you have a fully functioning heart.”
“I want it,” he said firmly now.
“This is a pretty big decision.  Are you planning on bleeding out?”
“Yes .  With this I hope not to.”  Hise poise surprised her for a moment.  Whatever he saw deep at Seven7 put a major fear in him.
Ryla took a step forward. , “Uh…if Railine is going to do something like this, I will too.  Is there any Neural chip I could get that would help my reflexes, or watch you guys better?”
Laina nodded. , “There areis a few.”
“The machine can do it, right?  If you are going to be working on Railine.”  Laina nodded to Ryla’s question.
Laina was touched by the selfless act out of Railine and Ryla.  “I will see what I can do myself, after I take care of Railine.,”
“In the meantime I need to grab some stuff for everyone else, and help little Ryla out.,”  Rox was leaving the room.  “Yo Rai, any requests for your room gift when you wake up?”
“I will take the heaviest armor we have.  I will also take the Jetstream or Flame Dancer flamethrowers, I forget what is in that room.  It all kind of blurs together as you may understand .  I think the Linear Launcher is there too, I’ll take that.”
“Railine is ready for my kind of party!”  Rox yelled.  “I bet to other girls you aren’t a big hit though.”
“Not usually .”
Laina started walking towards the medical lab.  There was a lot to do, and they had to move fast.  She turned to Railine, whom she had a growing respect for that had started as antipathy at the start of this day.  “You trust me on this?  Not to say anything of my skills but…”
“In this circumstance, I do.  I didn’t always.”
The admission was heartfelt and Laina did not say anything more as they walked into the room.





 
Kalco
Location: V-Plane, heading towards Sensor Anomaly 

In a rare moment for in his life, Kalco felt outgunned.  The landscape below him was dark, and there was nothing that could be seen in the air as the four of them were heading towards an anomaly on the sensors.  He was not outgunned necessarily in the physical sense, but that there were things occurring he was only vaguely aware of.  His pride and arrogance were a good shield for a majority of obstacles he had been through in his life.  Included in this is the raw might of the Aelisha empire and the power as an individual Aelisha agent he represented.
He had been set up to die in the Elyria Modality and was the sole survivor whereas all the Solarian soldiers had died gruesome deaths to the True Forms.  This was not to say that as an Aelisha there was something that prevented his death –, Aelisha were stronger than Solarians, naturally –, but a True Form could kill them almost as easily.
Someone somewhere might have thought it was suspicious, but it never went anywhere as any embedded Aelisha intel agents would have shut investigations into him down.  All that really remained was the unshakable idea someone higher than typical channels wanted him dead because he saw something in his extra curricular activitieswhile researching the no-name Solarian scientist, Trego.  That of course had the interesting situation, if true, that many agents helped keep him alive due to his flawless record, but elsewhere in the intelligence field or beyond, a different group preferred him silenced.
The outgunned feeling came from a resurrection of the feelings he had watching that man Trego execute a flawless military mission by himself, along with a re-purposed combat android and a cloaking alien, going from a nobody to a professional in one night.  There were things going on that the Aelisha did not have a full grasp on, and that scared Kalco because his entire life had been endless pride of how much the Aelisha dominated everything.
The encounter with the True Forms really dialed things in for Kalco as well, an entirely new threat of which there had been no evidence before, and now capable of wiping out elite groups.  One piece of evidence that bothered him, was that the True Form they killed on this that old ship went down far too easilyy.  Ironic that so much firepower was considered ‘too easy’, but he knew what they could actually take.  He had a couple ideas why this happened, none of which were good.
The plane had stopped, and the others had got out, but he was still lost in thought.  There were was a single set of foot prints at that ship before they got there, the fact that Zaier had activated it with only a single button press, and lastly the True Form dying too easily.  It felt set up.  It reeked of Elyria all over again.  Could he even trust those he was with?
“Are you okay?”  Feyria came up, placing her gloved hand on his armored shoulder,.  “Yyou’ve been holding your head this whole time.”
Kalco took the hand off his face,.  “Mostly.  Super bad headache.  Maybe those things do something to our mind.”  He had no proof one way or the other, but said it to get her off of him.
“You can stay here,” she offered.
“I will be okay,” he replied as he stood up and walked past her.
The head ache was not a lie.  Ever since they returned fromor Seven7 it started.  He could vaguely feel a distorted Emotion Field about the whole base, but it that sensation was never a strong suit of his and he filed it away without an answer.  The other thing that hurt his head, was the fact that some of this seemed vaguely familiar.  Being here with Feyria felt new, for example; but the scene at the ship had an almost dream-like familiarity to it.
“Something has definitely been here!”  Madigan was forced to yell in the harsh wind.  The snow was blowing, and the lights of the V-Plane highlighted what looked like a set of parallel tracks heading into a snow drift.
Kalco was holding his head again, gritting his teeth and only holding one eye open.  This was different.
He looked down at the two tracks in the snow, and looked forward towards where they disappeared.  They had been purposely manipulated to hide what it was, and in the snow there was little evidence left at all that anything had been here.
A lot of Leader Class soldiers might have more esoteric leanings than might appear at first glance.  Kalco of course was an Aelisha first and foremost, but he played the part of a Leader Class for a long time, and knew a lot about them.  There were always discussions on luck, circumstance, ‘edge’, and any number of small variables that could drastically change the outcome of a battle.  
The Ghost theory presented an answer that Kalco dove pretty hard into.  Various derivatives of it included life being composed of fragments of past ‘souls’, or the other common thought was universal expansions/contractions that life was loosely ‘relived’ a million iterations of – with the implication a single being was loosely aware of having lived this combination of events before.
The ‘old souls’ variations of Ghosts explained some things perhaps like Kalco’s obsession over Trego, that perhaps some ancient fighter woke up and knew all the skills he acquired.  It did not explain why this felt familiar to Kalco, and he had to at least consider the universal lifecycle variation as what might be occurring.  
He knelt down, putting a glove on the track.  To others it looked like he was investigating it, but he really could not stand much longer.
A complicating factor, was he that he had considered that, as an Aelisha, he might not be perceiving something that was occurring.  , as Trego was Solarian, and there was a high affinity for Line Artifacts for other races beyond the Aelisha.  Yet…  H, he lifted his head, looking at the three others, their suits light bouncing around in the night blizzard.  They certainly did not act odd at all.  None of them showed any evidence of a precognition like Trego had.  This was what was confusing him.  I, if Kalco was in something weird right now, and previous evidence showed Solarians might have a capacity to benefit from it, why were these three bumbling through life  like in every normal way?
For a moment he had to do a quick recollection if perhaps one of them demonstrated so prodigal ability but masked it, but could not find evidence of it.  All of them were generally accounted for the entire time.
Hey Feyria, this might be kind of weird, but does this place feel familiar to you at all? – Kalco.  He did not bother changing his avatar which was currently acting out a simple animation of pulling a pistol out turning this way and that while firing and spinning it while holstering it triumphantly.  The situation had turned dire enough changing something so stupid was a low priority.
No, not at all.  Why? – Feyria
Being an Aelisha, their ability to read between the lines of communication and body language was very high and Feyria demonstrated zero evidence she was at all lying.
Just got some déjà vu is all. – Kalco
“Let’s go,” Zaier said, as the four of them headed down the tunnel through the deep snow drift.  Feyria’s open admission hung in his mind though.  H, here was a Solarian, with zero feeling of anything wrong.  His own theories were shot open, and left wanting.
‘There will be structures down here,’ part of his mind said.  As they continued, it slowly started getting warmer and there was a light that grew as they got closer.  They came to a huge cavern where what could loosely be called ruins in its alien construction spread out before them.
“How the fuck…?”  Kalco asked.
“That’s what I want to know,” Zaier continued.
Only Kalco knew his question was not how these got here, but how he knew anything was down here.
“Looks like Reiko wasn’t uninhabited after all,” Feyria said.
“Clearly.  Was it always frozen like this?”  Madigan asked rhetorically.
“Maybe we might find some answers to what is happening in here,” Zaier said, walking towards it.
“Wait, you are going in that shit?”  Madigan asked.
Zaier turned,.  “Do you not understand how critical our situation is?  Our sister base was completely wiped out, our base was mostly wiped out, and may be destroyed right now, and we find an alien ship, and now an alien city on this planet?  If we do nothing, we definitely die, but if we are proactive, we might survive.”
Kalco lifted his nose and took a few breaths in, smelling something his subconscious triggered.  “Anyone else smell explosives?”  On his word everyone lifted their faces a bit. , Madigan was the last one to pull his hood off, and it all looked pretty funny to Kalco.  Solarian olfactory abilities were very, very lacking.  It was an embarrassment to even have a nose quite frankly.
“You are always are smelling weird things,” Feyria said.  No one else said anything.
“Looks like it was bombed or something, look, that wall looks busted up.”  He pointed to the side, where the sleek wall guarding the outside of the ruins was detonated inwards.  In this place it was impossible to tell any time, but the wall was broken unlike everywhere else.
“Whatever, let’s go.”  Zaier marched forward, and Kalco dutifully followed before the other two did.
Here is where the outgunned came back again.  This was not Aelisha design at all.  AT ALL.  No where in their history did architecture take on these strange shapes.  T, the sleekness was nice in some ways but it landed in that uncanny valley of looking familiar enough while also being repulsive.
Kalco looked up, about to cross the threshold before he paused.,  “Hhey where did Zaier…”  Hhe took one more step and felel into white.
“Shit…”  Hhe pressed himself up, and spreading away from him were bars of white and black at regular intervals.  He turned around and everywhere was this white/black/white scheme.  He was on a flat plane and took a few steps;  and nothing moved which was a bit more disturbing than if it at least shifted.
KALCOKALCOKALCO
A voice boomed all around him.
BACKAGAIN BACKAGAIN BACKAGAIN
HAHAHAHAHA a cacophony of laughs pounded down on him.
Okay, he snapped to attention.  He had been through this type of training before.  H, he was under some sort of hallucination.  He took a few steps back, and swung his arms wildly.  He needed to get out of whatever mental field he was in.  “Feyria!  Madigan!  Zaier!”  
ARE YOU WORTHY OF LIFE?
“Naturally!”  he yelled in defiance to the voice.
He suddenly was punched in the stomach.  He looked down and was legitimately confused because he had his armor on.  He started running and was being smashed by these impacts growing in intensity.
CAN YOU TAKE MORE?  ARE YOU WORTHY?
“This is nothing!” h He yelled while he ran.  His arms and legs opened up in sudden lacerations.  H, he fell to the ground from the surprise, knelt his way to standing, and was running again.
YOU POSSESS SOME VITALITY.  WILL YOU LISTEN?
“Yes!”
The next moment there was a loud wind, a static sound mixed with almost an alarm blaring in his head.  It was like watching a movie with all the scenes flashing in a single moment through his brain.
“Arghhh!”  Hhe grasped his head, trying to slow the pain down.  There was a scene in there that caught his eye during the pain, and it was as if seizing upon this, it slowed down and the pain went away as he felel into a trance.
It showed many races living in a harmony.  It showed planets and systems belonging to various races as different ships flew through the sky.  Cities of various construction, aliens of all types living on planets.  It showed more and more technologic ability of ships Jumping through space, planets being transformed, some planets being stripped of resources.  Everywhere things were moving up and up, faster and faster.  Scenes flashed by of millions of ships and technologic marvels.
The movie changed, it showed large dinosaur-like warriors steam rolling weaker races.  They were large, with lifeless light blue eyes lacking anything like a pupil.  It showed some angel-like aliens commanding from some sort of floating tank.  The angels and the dinosaurs appeared on the same team as they mowed all before them.  It showed Aelisha dying.  Solarians dying.  A black race with bladed arms dying.  Race after race getting blown away on the ground and in space.
INTERESTING
Next Kalco fell from a high area, crashing into a sand dune.  The heat started roasting him and he tried taking his jacket off which but it was stuck on him.  Glancing around he saw a water hole and trees.  H, he trotted across the dunes, his one hope by making it to the water.  He tripped, taking a mouth of sand.  He stood up, ran again, hit the edge of the oasis, tripped over something, and fell into the water.
He didn’t care, it felt so good.  He came coughing up into the air.
“Well this is rare…!”  Hhe turned as saw the most beautiful Aeli had had ever seen in his life standing there in regal clothes.  Her tail was the epitome of health as it was so full and vibrant of colors.  Her ears were so perky, so inviting.
“What…?” he began and crashed down onto a gray floor.
“You left me to die!”  He turned and recognized the face of a soldier that had died under his command.
“You knew something was wrong,” Elyria  said to him.
“You were so concerned about yourself, you forgot us,” another voice criticized.
Kalco yelled back, “No!  I only wanted to be a hero, it never involved sacrificing anyone!  I just wanted to save people!  I wanted to be the hero!”
“Laughable!” a A different voice challenged him.
Kalco was angry now.  This was a truth of his.  That is all he ever wanted to be.  He did these things to help others, not to leave a pile of bodies behind him.  He walked forward, ready to take this guy. , “I did everything because I thought it was right!”
NOT IDEAL BUT PASSABLE
He took another step and there was a ‘Vuushhhhh’ type sound as if air was being sucked away.  T, the scene turned white and he had to close his eyes.  In a few moments he was back in the ruins.  To his left was the bombed out wall and the destroyed area he had stumbled into.
He blinked a few times, pulling his jacket and armor back.  T, there were was no physical damage on his body even if in his mind he still felt the remnants of pain.  Even his intellect and soul felt tired.  
‘What…was that?’  He could not get past the feeling that something different occurred here, and that a large part of him being here right now was due to the destruction of part of this structure.  He had done better, and was also given an escape.
There was something critical imparted to him.  He recalled those visions of something in the past.  The aliens he did not recognize killing all the others.  The angel aliens looked very much like the True Forms.  The connection seemed like it could not be doubted.  The purpose or mechanism of this structure was something he could never understand, but on some very small level, he got whatever it was trying to tell him.
Further, it was quite clear his understanding might not be correct.  If these images were at all true, the entire history of the Aelisha might be inaccurate, given that there were Solarians fighting there as well.  Those advanced aliens were clearly fighting everything, but what was the purpose?  Why was there no evidence of any of this?
“Where is the evidence!?” h He yelled.  Only a muffled sound came back.  He looked at the ruins and it hit him – this was the evidence.  Some intellect likely long gone trying to test him to see if they could give the message.  But now, what did he do with it?  It was only vague, that there was a large scale conflict in the past  that nearly everything was wiped out by.
There was a muffled crash to his side, and saw the snow fly up from where Zaier’s body had looked like it had been tossed.
“Oh shit…,”  Hhe ran up, and checked but it was clear he was still alive from his moaning.  He lifted his head to see in one moment there was nothing, thean the next was Feyria appeared and fell the short distance.  He ran to her too, and before he got there Madigan appeared as well, crashing down.  All were alive, but unresponsive.
He drug their bodies out of the structure, outside of the wall proper and sat down, thinking about what he had gone through.  Something occurred that the others here did not go through, or ‘pass’ as the voice said.  It would be a long time before they woke up, and Kalco had a lot of time to think about what he had witnessed there.










 
Aria 
Location: Reiko-10, Fusion Reactor

Aria disliked cramped quarters, like the ones they were in right now.  The APC hummed outside the door: on, warm, and ready but inside the reactor the structure was lifeless and cold.
“This is different,” Railine said as the five of them were looking at some sort of growth that had started here.  The main room they were in was fine, but the door to the next room before the reactor proper was open and there were was what looked almost like a room that had been frozen and turned into a glittery art showroom.
“I’d like a necklace like that,” Rox said.  “That muted purple is really pretty.”
There was a strange geometry to the pattern, where at set distances were larger nodes of these crystals, and branching off of them were smaller and smaller sets;, it was all very symmetrical.  The larger nodes were the tallest, looking like a six-sided shape composed of three interlocking flat sheets as it rose like a mini spire from the metal floor.
“Yeah, it’s different it alright,” Laina said.  She held her arm up to stop anyone from getting close.
“It is disturbing, but they areit’s beautiful.  I, it’s like a crystal cavern,” Ryla said.
To Aria she could tell they radiated different energy, and saw that there was a slight thermal signature to them.  They were also , as well as putting out a small level of illumination on the shorter wavelength and likely extended past Solarian eyes.  “Fractals,” Aria said, hoping she would not have to explain the observation.
“Hmm?”  Ryla asked.  Aria pointed at the room, using her rifle.
“She’s right.,”  Railine gratefully took the point and ran with it.  “It is completely symmetric.  E, even the branching out appears to be in relation to those before it, subtly changing the whole pattern.”
“Well, what do we do?”  Laina held up her hand, pulled out a scanner, and shook her head slowly.  “I can almost feel the damage, and of course this says all we need to know.”
“We probably don’t have long before the reactor reaches meltdown if it is failing this fast,” Rox said seriously.
“It is happening differently…”  Railine’s head was tilted down.
“What do you mean?” a Asked Laina.
“Didn’t you see this at Seven7?”  Railine asked.
“No, why, did you?”
“Oh.,”  Railine’s voice was surprised.,  “I saw something like that there, and thought you said you saw something similar, maybe it was Solide or someone else.,”  Aria knew Railine was lying.  He had recently improved his ability to lie with the recent events happening, but he was honest in his heart and deception was not a strength of his.  That being said, Aria was not surprised the others missed the subtle clues like the minor aversion of his eyes.
Ryla turned to face the door, and Aria heard a very subtle sound, turning while raising her rifle.  The door was left unhinged , and the creature forced it open.  It was one of those figures that was at the door, and with one smooth move she fired at it, hitting it above the chest.  So far her hits seemed to suggest this is where it was most vulnerable, and the round hit home and dropped it.
“Why are they out here?  Aren’t they after the base?”  Ryla asked.
“No, they are after us.  They will destroy the base if they have to, but we are their target,” Railine answered and did not even look at the girl.
“It’s okay, Ryla, we are getting a lot better fighting them .”
“Yeah, you guys have been pretty amazing. , I’m just am glad I have been able to help at all.  I feel somewhat useless that all I can do is give you guys warning they might be coming.”
Railine comforted her, “Believe it or not, it’s really useful.  I don’t have any Psionic that warns me about that at all.  In an even battle I know I can hold my own, as long as I don’t get surprise attacked.”
“I have been really impressed with your fighting skill, actually,” Laina said to the firefighter.  “You weren’t a soldier or anything?”
He looked at her and gently said, “No never was, just kind of became one.”
“Fast learner.”
Railine laughed, and then started laughing much harder at something only he knew.  “Feels really slow from over here .”
“It’s slowly spreading…,”  Aria had walked over, and was pointing down at a little bloom in the floor.  The growth was slow but visible as they gathered around and saw it grow as if it was some turbo charged grass.
“Kinda gross,” Rox said.
Railine looked further down the door to the next room.  “We have a problem.  W, we need to at least stall that reactor until Madigan gets back, and we really need to do some critical repair work real soon here.  These reactors tend to melt down far faster than you would expect.”
Again, that last statement was a line;, his voice was accelerated by 7% when he spoke.  To Aria it was strange why he would be lying  about something like that.
“Can we touch this stuff?  Can we get rid of it?”  Ryla asked.
Laina had pulled out her Nano-Blade and was reaching the tip towards the little growth.  Railine lashed out and grabbed it, shaking his head no.  “Don’t.”
“Why?”
“It spreads.”
“To everything?” s She asked.  “It’s just my blade, I could scrape it off.”
“Your blade houses part of your soul in it.,”  Aria smiled to herself at his weird comments he occasionally said. , “Iit likely would react with your energy.”
“Okay…?”  Laina asked confused.
“You have seen this stuff before, right?  You told me about it once,” Rox said to him.  Rox was really hard to read for Aria.  She seemed pretty happy- go- lucky, but it was tough to tell as it seemed like a front.  Yet, when she spoke she betrayed no signs of manipulation in her voice, nor any evidence of lies or hostility.
“I’ve seen them a few times.  T, they are not invincible, but formidable.”  He turned towards Laina. , “I was not really joking about that part either.  I was at an isolated outpost on the edge of Solarian space, a lot like this, in a time what seems like lifetimes ago, and we encountered this before.”
“Yeah, I remember you telling me about that,” Rox coaxed him on.  “You said something how it reacted differently.”
“Laina,” Railine began, “tThis was probably classified stuff or will be when it gets out, and I only saw it at this outpost, but it had different reactions to people.  Some it really resonates with, and it infects them.  Kills them or worse.”
“Or worse?”  Ryla asked.
He didn’t answer.,  “Some are immune to it.  I think maybe it’s some Daijin Star disease or something, given its crystalline nature.  But in general the reaction is negative for nearly everyone.  It was not joke either that it appeared to loosely react to people’s items if they have had them a long time, like say your blade.  I can’t confess to know Daijin ‘biology’, to use the wrong term, but it has something to do with people’s vibrational energy I think.”
“Hmm, makes sense to me,” Rox  said.  Aria was not sure it made sense, but with one person agreeing already, Aria was not going to challenge the narrative.
“It affects biologics only?”  Aria asked her friend.
“Kind of.  Like a neutral item, this stuff is only lightly attached to.,”  Hhe grabbed a tool kit, pulling out a wrench and hit the crystal.  I, and easily scrapped it off the floor , it felel unceremoniously to the ground, disrupting the nice pattern it had going.  He tapped the wrench a few times and held it up.,  “All things considered, this likely doesn’t have that Daijin crystal disease, as it is a lifeless item.”
“My blade is lifeless,” Laina said.
“You don’t believe any of the older Terran warrior cultures about a weapon hold’s a person’s soul?” h  He asked;, she didn’t answer.  “I do.  Regardless, I could be way wrong, I am just telling you what I saw.  M, most people and their items resonate with these things, and the infection spreads to them.”
“Gross, they don’t look so pretty to me anymore,” Ryla said.  “What do we do?”  She stepped away from the edge of their progress.
“Two thingsThere are two ways to stop these things from what I’ve seen, both are notneither are that complicated.  I, that is if you put a strong batch of sterilization chemicals together you can destroy it;, that’s the slower and safer way.  Put them it on auto, and have a good sized container of it, and it works just like a nano block, but cleans.”
“I know how they work,” Laina said.
“I didn’t doubt you did, I am just saying you need a lot, and that they are in fact are effective on this.”
“The other?”  Aria asked him, watching the broken crystal slowly start sending out its on new network of a pattern.
“Fire.  Burn them down.”
“Not in the reactor,” Laina said quickly.
Railine nodded.,  “You see the problem.”  He un-slung his flamethrower and bent down, holding the pilot light next to the broken crystal.  It went through a quick flash of the colors of the rainbow as it turned a pink/red and dissolved into a red gas that sparkled upwards before fading away.
“That looked pretty definitive,” Ryla said.
“Yeah, but we have two rooms to get through, and I can’t risk starting a fire here.”
There was a sudden surge of energy and the building shook.  There was a sparking of some sort of lightning or energy in the upper part of the large room.
“Hot damn, never seen that before!”  Rox yelled.  It died away but was ominous something bad was happening.
“What do we do?” a Asked Laina.  “We have a lot of chemicals back in the lab, but, do we have time?”
Railine looked forlornly at the door into the crystal cavern. , “Wwe need to hope one  of us doesn’t resonate with these things.  You can just knock them off your armor if they don’t, and just use the chemicals to eliminate any trace.  But someone has to get in there and feed a couple of nano blocks with the instructions I have programmed in.  We need to stop the imminent threat now, and then shore it up later enough till Madigan gets back to do something.  Maybe shut it down properly.”
“But what about the base?” Ryla asked.
“Don’t see us living here long.”
Laina put her chin in her hand. , “Iinteresting, it does seem bad.  So what do we do?  How do we test?”
“Easy.  P, poke it with your blade .  Y, you have had it long enough it should have a bit of your essence.  We see if it’s there’s a reaction, and I kill it with fire to make sure it’s clean.  I think I’ll have you three go first, as you are unlikely to not resonate anyway and you can go back and grab the chemicals.”
Ryla looked back at him.,  “You say almost everyone does, what if you two fail also?”
Railine took a deep breath in.  “I think you know what I’d do, if it meant saving you guys.”
Ryla frowned.
“Come on, we don’t have time.”  Laina stepped forward, tapping a crystal with her blade.  “Do I hold it or what?”
He shrugged. , “Not sure.  L, leave it a bit, these things grow fast.”
She waited, taking it away and they all looked close.  From Aria’s distance it was obvious her blade now had the stuff.
“Ew…”  Laina gritted her teeth.  “I just knock this off, right?”  She tapped the floor rapidly, and the small lines on the blade did not disappear;, they had started to turn red.
He held up the flamethrower,.  “Like I said, it seemed it could pick up something we might not understand about our being.  I, if that was just any Nano-Blade maybe, but it’s yours.”  She held it out, and he put the lightest of pressure on the trigger as a small flame came out.  H, he swung it up and down the blade, pulling away faster than Laina appeared to like.
“Is it really clean?”
“These things don’t like fire.,”  Hhe smiled knowingly.
Rox stepped up,.  “Well, what do I use?”
“You got a custom Linear launcher, don’t you?”
She pulled out a weapon out of her bag, set it on the ground and it unfolded a few times as things snapped into place.  It was a square, longish tube with a handle on one side and a small computer near the grip.  “I call it ‘Flames of Sorrow’,” she said in a serious voice.
Railine looked at her deadpan.,  “Are you being serious right now?” 
“What!?  Everyone else gets weapon names and I don’t?”
“It’s a custom Linear launcher, it’s not like its some Axl weapon!” h He shot back.  Aria knew they were friends, but they seemed more familiar more than she gave them credit for.  She might have to update her mental dossier on the two of them.  Further, she had never heard of what an ‘axl weapon’ was but no one else said anything.
“Fine!  I can’t wait to go with Laina anyway!”  She stepped up, touching the tip of her weapon, pulling it back.  Same deal .  Railine hosed the tip of her weapon down with a small wave of fire.
“It didn’t have red lines like mine,” Laina said.
“Guess you really resonate badly with them,” he said, and nothing more.
“What do I do?  I don’t have a weapon,” Ryla said.
“Here,” Laina said, handing her a knife.
Railine shook his head. , “Won’t work that way.  Either that knife is neutral and shows nothing, or it has your energy Laina and we know the crystals like you.”
Ryla frowned.,  “Time is running out.”
“Your ribbon,” Railine said.
She looked surprised. , “But it’s not a weapon.”
“Doesn’t have to be.  Just has to have your essence.  Hurry up.”
She nodded, pulling her ribbon out.  Her hair fell down over the light armor she had on.  Aria was surprised;, Ryla looked fairly cute with her long hair down.  
“My ribbon is going to burn ,” Ryla said, while she was holding the tip of it to a crystal.
“Part of it.,”  Railine did not pull the punch.
She stepped back, and the edge of it had soft purple  lines marching upwards.  It was enough.  Railine took the ribbon, set it down on the ground, and burnt away a part of it.  He stomped out the fire and handed it back to her.  She frowned at the slightly wet, and now burnt ribbon .  She reluctantly tied her long hair partly back up.
He looked at them.,  “That’s the three of you, go.  We don’t have much time.  Get the chemicals, come back, and neutralize the whole place, and feed the blocks into the control panel.”
“You are talking like you might die.  Y, you are going to do it , aren’t you?”  Ryla was worried.
He turned away.,  “I don’t know what is going to happen .  I am merely preparing you.”
Ryla came up to him, grabbing his wrist. , “Don’t die.  Don’t sacrifice yourself, there has to be another way.”
“I am hoping there is.”  He looked to Laina.,  “Go on, we don’t have much time.”
“Right.”  She nodded decisively.,  “Let’s go.”  She turned, and the two other women followed them her out.  They heard the APC rev up and they were gone in the dark blizzard.
“You planned it to be just me, didn’t you?”  Aria asked in a more open manner now that the others were gone.
“I did.”  He turned and faced her. , “What I am going to tell you is going to sound crazy, but the more I talk, the more sense it is going to make.”
There was a loud crack above them of the unrestrained energy again.  It caused both of them to flinch a bit.
“I knew you were lying to them.”
He looked firmly at her. , “We don’t have time right now.  T, this reactor is going to melt down very soon unless you throw a nano block in with the loaded protocols.”  The key word in that statement was ‘you’ meaning Aria.
“Me?”
He grabbed her shoulders,.  “Aria, not right now.  I know you can’t be infected by these.  Y, you absolutely have to trust me.  You know in your heart it won’t infect you either.”  He shoved a block to her,.  “Here, you know what to do.  I will explain everything when you stall it.”
He turned, lifting his flamethrower and shot a precise jet at a creature that had come through the door.  In practiced fashion had pulled out a fire extinguisher and was trotting over, putting out the incipit fire.  “Go!  We all die if you don’t.”
Aria knew she would not be infected by this, but how did he?
She turned, holding the block tightly and ran straight into the crystal field.  She dodged around the bigger ones, and could feel almost a friction growing on her feet from the things latching on.  For a moment she thought that maybe she did indeed march straight into her own death and wondered what it would be like with those crystals digging into her body.  
She stopped and, stomped hard.  T as there was a cracking sound and her feet felt lighter, allowing her to and she ran run faster and deeper into the next room.  Both It looked like an ice cave of sorts with these long flat spires coming from the ground and ceiling.  They all appeared to be either two, four, or six sided constructed out of these panes.
She dodged around a big one, but brushed up beside it, and in a few moments saw the lines growing on her armor.  It disgusted her and she scrapped at it rapidly, flicking her glove afterwards and it appeared clean for now.
The control console was predictably covered in it and she wondered what she was going to do, and decided discretion was not a good move here.  The nearer she got, she could feel her tissue start to break down, some sort of radiation perhaps.  There was a steam in the air from the higher temperature, and in this room there was the constant sparking of energy bolts in the air.  The large reactor in front of her vibrated and moaned angrily.
She arrived at the console, braced her hand, and swept hard over the injection port.  She knocked most of the crystals out, but the hole was still clogged.  Rapidly, she pulled out her knife and stabbed it in, digging around to scrape the crystal stuff out.  She could feel her feet getting anchored in and stomped hard again.
She had not felt this intensity in a while.  S, shooting was calming to her but this was unlike anything she had ever done.  Holding She held the block out, and hopedhoping Railine knew what command to have, and held it to the hole where the block melted down to a liquid and flowed into the hole.  
Aria wondered what would happen, and a large energy bolt caused her to cover.  A few moments later the angry vibration seemed to have slowed, and the sparking in the air rapidly died down.  There was still a very dire feeling in the air, but the rapid necessity seemed to have gone away at least for now.
She looked down at herself and almost cried from some degree of shame as she had these small little things growing out of her armor, her pants, her knife, even Broken Promise.  She turned and ran rapidly out of the two rooms.
Railine was there with his flamethrower on low, somewhat like a blow torch destroying the edge of them, but at the rate they were spreading it was mostly just holding the line.
“Aria!”  She felt happy seeing him.  I, it had only been a very short bit but the intensity and realness of what she had done felt like a big thing had been accomplished.  “Stand there and shake it all off.  K, knock it off, and use a knife to scrape if you have to.”   She stood in a clean circle he had, and she stamped around, shaking her hair, brushing everything wildly.  He laughed good naturedly at her. , “It’s like you got fire ants or something.  Here hold up your boots.,”  Sshe did and he held the torch to them very briefly as she stepped away.
He turned it up slightly, burning all the small crystals she had knocked off herself.  It was gross seeing them, like some little parasite trying to bore into her.
“Let me see your knife.,”  Sshe handed it to him, and heard scraping on her back, as well as on her greaves.  He poured over her a bit, knocking or scraping at a few areas.  “God, this stuff is so gross when you see it like this, so persistent.”  He held up the knife, sterilizing it in flame and burning the smaller pile under her.  “Your gun has some too, want me to get it?”
“I’ll hold it,” she said.  She swung it around and he blasted it clean.
“I think you are good.  Just stand there a bit and see if you see anything spreading out.”
He went back to maintaining the line on the encroaching crystals.
“On my side,” she noted.  Hhe came over and saw there was a little spot they missed.  S, she scraped everything away, burnt the knife and the ground and afterwards she no longer had anything.  “So…?” s She saidasked.  “How did you know?”
“We don’t have a lot of time, so I need you to promise you can’t say anything to anyone else, because it will mess up the loop.”
“The loop?”
“Just promise me.  A deep promise Aria, one you will never break.”
The words of course were powerful.  S, she was very loyal and a broken promise had set her life in motion.  
She was trusting and pure, and the promise the two of them had made was something she would stick by her whole life.  However for him Iit was not something he valued so hig hly.  
The memories of clutching his rifle to her chest, holding it and crying up on that cliff waiting for him.  The promise she had forever intended to keep, twisting and turning in her fragile soul, laying broken at her bloody feet.  Wailing and crying as she stumbled down the canyon walls.
The place promised in their early days, left behind with a second glance.  The quest for truth and answers ending in a rough storm, the trigger pull missing neither target with the single round.  The unmissed shot killed more than the man and the woman, it left her emotions dead in the rain that washed all evidence away.
“I’ll never break a promise.”
“I know.,”  Hhe came up to her, and gave her a huge hug, it was rarea rarity for him.  She was stiff in his grip, but slowly softened.
“Aria, I…”  Hhe paused. , “Llet me just talk a bit and try to listen to what I am saying.”
She nodded.
“We are stuck in some sort of time loop.  I, it has to do something with this reactor but that is not quiteet everything.”  His words were coming fast, trying to jam as much into her as he could in a short time.,  “I have lived these series of days for somewhere over 18,000 times.,”  Hhe pulled his bracer back on his armor, he hadshowing the number 18 on his arm.  “I have seen thousands upon thousands of different ways the events unfold but they are all loosely the same.  I have learned to fight because I have been killed over and over, and have literally lived thousands of battles.  If Laina ever gets hit by these mutated figures, or if she ever touches these crystals, she resonates with them in a way that she eventually turns into this higher dimensional being and kills us.”  He was talking fast so as to not give her an opening. , “I know you think I am crazy.  I have talked with you thousands of times.  I know your prior name was Suzene, and you were a Classed Sniper who was partners with ‘Valent’, who is Zaier.”
“How…?”  She gasped, her heart beating faster.
“I know you are an android, a ‘recycle’ or something as Solide called it.,”  Hhis words hit her hard.
She took a step back, worried.
He lifted his hands.,  “Don’t, I am your friend.  Trust me.  Y, you have shot me before, it doesn’t end goodwell.  Just listen a bit more.  The deepest or highest level of energy and matter around us is composed of these things called Axls, it which is basically like an animating energy.  There seems to be some sort of filter, in which people are either neutral to them, respond positively, or respond negatively.”  He shook his head, glancing at the door rapidly.,  “Hholy shit,” swearing was very, very rare for him, “there is so much to say and so little time.”
He looked back at her, grasping her shoulder to get her to look at him.  “Okay, look, in this time loop apparently only some of us can perceive we are even in it.  Solide and myself are the most aware and often we still forgot loops that happen.  Kalco and Ryla loosely get it, but we can’t tell to what extent.  Oh my god, the emotion field, the Ttrue fForms, the LineGods, there is so much…shit.,”  Hhe was under clear stress.
“What is going on?”  Aria asked.  Railine seemed crazy, but displayed something like a deep wisdom in his ranting.
“Aria, you possess, or possessed the highest Axl affinity out of all of us.  B, basically you can use Axl items without getting killed, and they recognize you faster than the others.  But you died and were partly reconstructed as an android.”
Aria had a sudden surge of emotion and fell to her knees crying.  He came over and knelt next to her, taking his glove off.  His scarred hand gripped hers.
“I know this isn’t easy, and I am sorry I have to bring back this pain.  When you died and were reconstructed, something changeds that you lose lost some of that affinity.  Y, you are still higher than me and Solide but that might explain why you can’t perceive that you are in a time loop if that is at all related.”
He gripped her hand and kept talking as fast as he could, almost stumbling over words,.  “I know you might not believe me.  You know everything I have said about you is true,.  I have slowly learned this spending countless time with you, loop after loop.  I know that there was some guy you really loved and he betrayed you very deeply.  He broke your vows, and he was killed by you.  Your weapon was his.  After that you served in the Classed military with Zaier under his real name of Valent where you two were assassins.  I know that you have some mental hinge regarding that weapon and have a breakdown if you lose it.  Solide found that out.  I could never determine where in your past you died, and perhaps it is related to your strong burden you carry regarding that weapon.”
Aria’s tears were flowing.  She of course knew she was an android, a fake.  A simulacrum of a real person.  Just a toy to be used and thrown away.  Railine rubbed her hands.
“Aria, I care about you very deeply.  I can say that I have a love for you after all these times I have spent with you.  You are a very cool girl, your insights and shyness are cute.  You have this pain in your soul that you have a chance to fix here.  I am not sure but this is almost like some sort of purgatory we are in.  It literally might be that, because it doesn’t feel like reality after you die a thousand times.  That guy is dead and gone.  He betrayed you, others may or may not.  But you have to learn that others actually can and do care about you.  Zaier cared about you, and thinks you died.  In a way, his story is like yours, only you can end his positively.”
“Oh my god…” Aria said, still crying but seeing things from a new point of view.  There was never a vow between her and Valent, but there were very close.  It was so much like the first time.  She never betrayed him at all, but was never telling him she was alive after they both thought they died in that battle a sort of betrayal because he promised to always remember her?  It was.
“You can fix your past with Zaier.”
“He doesn’t trust anyone.,”  Aria sniffled.
“That’s true.  But if things go according to plan, he will.  Plus he still has your necklace.”
“You do know that…” Aria said with wonder.  “Is this really happening?”
“I deeply wish it wasn’t.  But everything I told you was is completely true.”
Everything was happening so fast, but he knew far too much.  A lot of his actions made sense.  He never saw these crystals at some remote military base;, this was the military base but in the past.  Heis moves in combat were far too refined, leaving even Classed Soldiers behind with his speed, calm, and clarity.  He knew Laina would react badly, and why her blade had the red on it unlike the others.  He knew Aria was immune, and left her after the others had gone.
“What is going to happen?”  Aria asked.
“I got a plan, but I can’t really say more.,”  hHe stopped and, laughed.  “Damn it, now I know what Rox means all the time.”
“Do you not trust me?  After all this!?”  She wiped some tears away.  Her long hair on her face was wet from them.
“No, I trust you completely, that’s why I told you all this.  What happens after has to be completely natural for it to work.”
“But what about what you told me?” s She asked.
“That’s the power of the base dimension, we aren’t bound by the magnitude of our actions.  I am setting us up a new Chrono Line so we can achieve that distant Fate I know we can get!”
“What do I do?”  She wiped away the last of her tears.  T, there would be time for mourning later,; she was realizing how serious of a situation they were in.  She also wondered how many time they had a similar conversation.
Railine closed his eyes, smiling very grimly.  He spoke slowly, “I can explain anything you have questions about later, if this ever ends.  What you need to do though, is make sure no one here dies first, and that no one gets hit because either Zaier or Laina will turn, and the rest of us die.  Ryla knows far more than she lets on.  P, partner with her, she can Psionically sense these creatures.  The first thing is to finish repairing this reactor once we get it sterilized.”  He pointed to a large stack of nano blocks they left at the door.  “You must get this done when what happens occurs.”
He stopped talking, laughing very slowly to himself. , “Unbelievable how set up this all has to be.”  He shook his head, opened his eyes at her and kept talking.  “After, all of us head back, only you two won’t be occupied , likely.  You two need to go make your stand in the main room there to buy Laina time.  Just the two of you.  T, tell her you need her to bait the creatures;, it will be an understanding both you twoof you will be comfortable with.  In my room there is a weapon, you need to give it to Ryla.  H, have it with you and throw it when things are at their worst.  She will use it.”
“No she won’t.”
“She will.”  Railine did not stop.  “You need to get Zaier alone and talk.  He won’t be infected and you two can make up for the past.  Lastly, two things.”  He made a show of patting pockets on his armor,.  “I don’t have my ReNew pak.  You need to detect  this fact.”
“What?”
He did not answer.  “Here.,”  Hhe reached deep in his armor, pulling out this a beautiful flower.  It looked like an orchid or a lily with long elegant petals.  It was colored a mix of blue, white, and a touch of black.  The main petals were blue with the outline and coloration of white.  The main core of the flower had a black and white pistol coming out of it.  Below the main petals were four long white leaves of a sort.  It did not have a stem;, it was as if someone had cut off just the flower.  As he held it, there was a sprinkle or sparkle that slowly fell off the flower.  It had this a slow sparkle to it as if it was permanently lightly snowing underneath it.
“My god…it’s beautiful.”  She held her hands carefully under it.  He put it in her hands, and it was warm.  She felt a healing, revitalizing energy to it.  “What is it?”
“It’s called an Ice Rose.”
“Do they grow here?”
He shook his head no,.  “It’s an Axl or Line artifact.  Composed of pure, dense Axls.  See how it radiates and reacts?  It senses your affinity.”
Broken Promise was her most important possession, but had never been given something of such sensed value.
“What do I do with it?”
He laughed. , “Frame it if you want.  It’s ‘mine’ for now, but I need to not have that temporarily as it will raise more questions than good.  All Line artifacts do different things.  W, weapons are obvious, but ones like this are usually more interesting.  This one makes you nearly immune to cold, and slowly heals your body.”
“I can feel the heat, it’s this a soft protecting heat.”
The APC had pulled up.
Railine glanced at the window and frowned.  “Hide it, and give it back to me when no one is around.”
“When?”
“You will know.”
Railine leaned forward, gave her a hard hug and whispered in her ear.  “Remember, I don’t have my ReNew pak.  G, give that to me later.  Y, you have to be the one that loads the nano blocks and let Laina do her thing.”
“I don’t…”
Aria was cut off by Ryla and Laina.  “Hey, what happened?”  The two women came in carrying tubs of the chemicals.  It was overkill, but Railine didn’t need to tell them he already knew that.
“Aria didn’t resonate, and she bravely slowed it down.  We spent time cleaning her up.”
“Wow, that’s lucky,” Ryla said.
“It’s something, alright.  You leave Rox back there?”  He walked over, backing up to the door and opening one of the boxes.
“Yeah, her and the dogs are taking care of some marauding creatures,” Laina said.
“Was it safe to leave her alone?”  Ryla asked.
“She’s pretty tough.  Plus these things have a hard time with our dogs for some reason, she will be fine,” Railine said to her.  He pulled out a small pad out of the sterilization chemical block, typing in instructions.  “Okay, let’s get those chemicals going.  Ryla, have you used them before?”
“Once,” she replied as she took the first block he handed her.
He opened a few of them, programming the blocks and handing them to Laina and Ryla who went to go set them on the ground.  Much like nano blocks, it was like an aware blob that spread out and moved forward.  Through a combination of strong acids, neutralizing agents, and various thermogenic reactions controlled by nanites, they swept forward.  There was not a dissolving sound, but that might be the easiest way to describe what it looked like as the pillars were slowly melting into the silver chemicals.
“Glad you brought a lot, we are going to need them.  Hey Ryla, go over in that far corner and set a couple there.” He handed her a huge stack.  It seemed overkill, but Aria was not familiar with it, so deferred to his judgment.
“Right.”
Aria was in the middle of the room, holding the stack of repair blocks she would feed into the reactor to help slow down whatever was wrong.  She was glad they were making progress getting rid of this filth on the floor, but could not help but feel something was wrong here.
Railine was standing at the door, holding a block maybe to hand to Laina who had just finished placing one and was going to turn back to him.
Railine winked his left eye at Aria at around the same time Ryla was turning.  “Watch o…”
From behind in the lights of the APC, a hovering figure that had some sort of demonic angel wings came into view.  In the next instant there were three pink panes that looked vaguely like the things being melted on the floor that shot out from it.  In the dark it was clear there were actually lit, but it was a small detail.  They hit Railine, one in his chest, one in his hip, and one at his right knee.  It cleaved him apart  instantly as he fell to the ground and Ryla’s scream was eventually blocked out by the sonic filters in Aria’s ears.
The man she had cared for, her friend, the person she promised…fell like a ragdoll as his body was torn apart and the blood spewed out of him, covering Aria and Laina in a gruesome farewell.  He had talked about animating spirits only a little bit ago, and so quickly it was cut right out of him.  Everyone around stood in shock of pure surprise of how fast life could be extinguished .

 
???
Location: Unknown

The figure sat there silently, watching the various screens in front that were set up.
Things were getting interesting.  It was unexpected that, he did not expect Railine to would have an Axl artifact like that.  Giving it to that girl seemed stupid.
Turning The figure turned to watch a different vid, it showedthe screen showing the group over at the Sensor Anomaly.  They had survived the first challenge, mostly due to the destruction in the ruins that apparently damaged them enough they did not work properly.  Now here was where things got fun.  Looking over the bank of remote detonators, there were a few remaining.  
A grin came over the figure’s face as the group on the screen came closer…closer.
CLICK
On the screen an explosion ripped behind them. , Zaier was the furthest in the back and took it hard.  His body was shattered and, thrown down to the ground.   as Kalco and Madigan took some of the blast but were far enough they looked back in shock.
Oh?  Perfect.  A large piece of metal from the wall had blown away and cut through his Zaier’s lower torso, sitting halfway through his unmoving body.  The figure laughed,; it could get used to this.  There was an understand assumption of that any ‘god’ would likely be on a power trip, causing misery.  That It was addicting.
Unfortunately there was no sound transmission, and they were on the edge of the screen as it were.  There was were a lot of arms flailing and expressive faces that looked like them yelling at to each other.
Wow, the accomplish  was right about the theory,: they do sense despair.  On a different screen there was a True Form that had appeared in the Ssensor Aanomaly.  Heh…just a little further .
CLICK
What was god, if not an equal opportunity misery creator?
More could be watched in a bit.
On another screen if was Railine; if he was not dead, he was very close to it.  The rest of them stood frozen facing down the True Form like what had always happened when it had a lock on your brain or soul.
Time to end this party.
CLICK
A bomb on the underside of the APC exploded, tearing apart the side of the wall where this the other set of drama was unveiling itself.
The figure laughed, pulling destructive strings from the back  like this was largely entertaining.
Now it sat , sitting forward, enraptured by what would come next…  Wwould they survive?




 
Ryla
Location: Reiko-10, Fusion Reactor

Ryla stood in shock as to what was occurring in front of her.  Railine had been torn apart by the surprise attack of a True Form.  She had felt it coming when it got close, but she was too far at the time to warn Railine.  The three had been frozen staring at this dimensional threat in front of them when, to make matters worse, a huge explosion outside detonated as the APC was launched into the sky.  It was on fire as it left her field of view, and the wall and /door wereas blown apart, covering Railine in rubble and incinerating the True Form.
“It’s not dead…” Ryla mumbled, stepping backwards.  She had set a large amount of the sterilizing chemicals down only moments ago, but it seemed so useless now.
“Railine!”  Laina  yelled, taking a few steps forward.
Aria had knelt to the ground, and fired at the figure that was slowly becoming visable through the flames.  Her weapon was very powerful and radiated with a bit of Ryla’s race in terms of its technology.  It hit the creature hard as blue splashes exploded out the backside.  
It raised its hand to attack Aria when Laina had closed the distance, slashing with her blade.  The near-ethereal substance likely surprised her as her blade flew through it, with only the smallest of damage that Ryla knew.
The two of them would not kill it fast enough.  Ryla dashed forward with a cry. , “Hey!”  She swung her arms wildly, hoping to attract the wrath.  It was not working and Ryla could see Laina’s fate of being impaled by the creature.  She dove at her, hitting her mid-attack as they stumbled forward.
No one would see the move Ryla pulled, but she pivoted slightly in the air, positioning her legs onto Laina’s back and kicking off of Laina, propelling her to the ground faster, but also changing Ryla’s positioning so the spray of the solid state energy attacks impaled the ground in-between them.
Aria fired and Laina looked back for a moment thinking Ryla had turned on her.  She soon , realized she had not and slashed at the floating creature again.  Ryla was struck by the bravery of Laina, standing against such a thing, but it was likely due to ignorance of never seeing what they could do.
The snow was blowing in hard in from the collapsed wall, and the APC which was back on the ground and in flames behind them presented an apocalyptic scene of fire highlighting the fearsome enemy right in front of them against the dark snowy sky.
Aria delivered round after hyper velocity round straight into its head, and without any warning the creature froze, jerked a few times, as itthen flashed a brilliant light.  It was too blinding to see and in the next moment red sparkly dust was in the air for a few moments.
Whoever had sabotaged the APC had inadvertently saved the three of them.  T, the explosion was powerful enough to severely weaken the True Form that two mere Solarians could kill it.
“Railine!”  Ryla yelled as she started lifting rocks away to find themhim.
“Be alive, be alive…” Laina repeated as she dead- lifted large sections of wall away.
Aria was over now as well, and despite her skinny frame her strength was the highest out of the three of them without Ryla truly showing her hand.  In the crisis like now, Ryla showed much more than anyone would normally believe out of her, but with Aria lifting huge amounts as well no one would know anything.
“Railine!”  Aria saidcried, after lifting a piece and crashing it to the side.
His eyes were closed, his face dirty and bloody.
“Watch out!”  Laina slid in, running her hands over a series of areas on his body.  “Get the rest off of him!” s  She yelled at the two of them.  Ryla and Aria nodded to each other, working down from the top of Railine.  
“Is he alive?”  Ryla asked.
“Shut up!”  Laina had pulled a Medi-kit out of her backpack.  Her special surgery scalpel she always kept on her was out, and despite the diminutive size of it, it cut through his armor like nothing.  She was deftly cutting him out of the large suit with a skill that impressed Ryla.
“Help me,” Aria said.
“Right.,”  Ryla looked back, grabbing a large block the two of them lifted, balanced it precariously and pushed it to the other side.  His lower body lay there like any other lifeless object.
“His leg,” Aria said, pointing to the fact his was missing his leg at his knee.
She nodded, as they lifted some more rocks out of the way.  It was so frustrating having to dig through this, hoping his part would be right there.
“Right here.,”  Sshe saw the blood before anything, and crawled under a piece of the wall, pressing up. , “Grab it!”  Ryla yelled, and she pushed hard against the wall.  A normal Solarian would never be able to handle how much weight she was currently lifting.
Aria grabbed the lifeless leg, sliding it out, and holding the area Ryla was under.  “Hurry.”
Ryla let go, and saw Aria flinch at how much weight was actually there but she rolled out of the way.  They stood up and looked at the strewn parts of their friend Railine.
“His ReNew pak…where is it!?”  Laina’s hands danced over his jacket and body.
Aria had knelt down as well, her hands were pouring over his lower body, checking his pockets.  “He lost it!  He never grabbed another  when he mentioned it,”  Aria said.  “He never got another one as we were attacked.”
Laina made some sort of angry sound, and ripped his coat off.  His lifeless upper body lay in front of them, ironic in how obvious his musculature was yet so useless against that creature.
There was a loud rumbling, and they looked above them when a spark of lightning shot through the sky.
“How!?”  Ryla yelled. , “Ddidn’t you fix it?”
“Only stalled it.”
This was bad.,  Railine was either dead, or very close to it, and the reactor was nearing some critical stage yet again.  The only good thing in their favor was that the next room was mostly cleaned due to the chemicals.
Aria held out her ReNew Pak,.  “Use mine.  T, tell me what to help you with Laina.”  Aria had also dropped her advanced Medi-kit by Laina’s side with it open and spread out.  The rehearsed nature of it impressed the medic ;her, she Aria was never a medical person to a large degree but seeing those who were was like a well orchestrated machine.
Laina was kneeling at this point, leaninged back with closed eyes, and breathing very fast.  “His core is still alive, but just the nervous system and the heart.”  Some part of his nanite programming had sealed part of his body.  Part of his guts had spilled out, but not completely, owing to some preservation protocol within them.  Injuries of this nature often led to an N-Limit but the person was going to die anyway and ifunless they could get medical help, then they would have survived an injury that would for sure kill a non-nanited Solarian.
Above them the occasional sparking heralded a bad omen.
“I need to go, otherwise we all die,” Aria said, coldly running to where she had dropped all the blocks and ran deeper into the reactor.
Ryla knew a little about medical, and that was mostly about using the basic Medi-kit, or the simplest application of a ReNew pak or the less effective blood paks.
Ryla bent down, picking up Aria’s pak she had left. , “Hhere.”
Laina had gone back to dragging Railine’s legs up to his core.  Ryla understood and grabbed his ankle and handed it to her.  It was a gruesome task but thought back to her ancestors who likely were bathed in ‘blood’ and climbing over the bodies of their comrades and was steeled with the simpler task.
Ryla offered the pak again to Laina.  T, the small pen injector could save him,; it had saved crazy injuries.
Laina slapped it away.,  “Birther!”  She yelled at her, pointing to Railine’s abdominal, and Ryla saw right away near the severing of his lower body where his guts were still somewhat spewed out something innocuous: a belly button.
Ryla stood there confused, and Laina burst out, “They used different versions, they aren’t completely compatible!”  She shook her head, letting it go.,  “Ryla, listen to me very carefully.  D, dig through that kit, I need you to mix four parts UDT with one part nanite stabilizer.”
Laina said nothing more and went back to Railine’s body.
Ryla ripped open the pack, and wished she had spent more time knowing where things were.  ‘Where is it, where is it…?’  The ignorance was shameful but the threat to Railine was real.
Laina was talking to herself.  “You’re not N-Limiting on me…no, I am going to save you.”  She took what Ryla knew was a booster and stabbed it in his chest.  Ryla found the uUndifferentiated Ttissue, and in a different section found the nanite stabilizer.  She had no idea what the ratio meant or would do, but some quick math and approximation shoved the stabilizer into the UDT bottle and shook violently.
“Nanite over-ride blockers onboard,” Laina said to herself, turning away after another injection.  Ryla was confused about this, because essentially Laina had shut down Railine’s natural nanite healing protocols.  Doing this shut down the sealing it had done on his upper and lower body.  As a result blood started leaking out while his guts started coming as well.
“Here,” Ryla said.
She Laina nodded. , “Okay, push in his intestines and hold his legs to his body”  The words were short, but the task was grim.  Ryla cringed as she took his intestines that were leaking down and dimly noted how they were warm and wet and shoved them in his body.  She was surprised how little room there actually was inside.  With Laina’s help as she had moved his legs.  She The medic rubbed something over the major arties in his lifeless legs and connected that to the body she was holding closed.
Ryla pulled out her bloody hand from where the two pieces of him joined.  Laina wasted no time smearing something else over the entire ‘weld’ of his body, and took the mixture Ryla had made, rapidly fillinged a syringe with it and jamminged it in two areas of his abs.  She measured using her fingers various depths on his hips, injecting more.
She turned around and grabbed something else, this entire time Ryla feeling very useless.  Watching Laina work mechanically and skillfully Ryla was aware of a deep frequency that suddenly that spoke to her on a level like her old harmonic plates she missed so dearly.  
Ryla swallowed, knowing what it was, but there was no way he should have one.  She looked at Laina, still mumbling various medical things to herself, stabbing here, rubbing there.  At one point she whipped her scalpel out, and cut open his stomach and shoved her hand in, moving something around and sealing the hole back up with a paste.
Ryla moved slowly to the pocket on his pants that Aria was poking around in. She very carefully flipped open the top to not attract Laina’s attention and only needed to pull back a bit to see something softly glowing in his pocket.  Being this close, she did not need to get closer.
Railine had a Condensed Axl Object in his possession.
That fact staggered Ryla.   
“More UDT, hit him with a booster again, he is still trying to N-LIMIT.”  Ryla handed her the rest of the UDT out of Aria’s kit.  She dutifully took out a booster shot and stabbed it in his leg.  Ryla pulled out her own small kit and assembled any of the parts Laina might need.  To her right Railine’s foot still hung unattached, f.  Freezing in its own blood on the ground.
Ryla wondered if her own ReNew pak would work on himer;, the answer was likely no , or very reduced.
She felt something coming again.  She tTurned to see six of the figures jerking near the burning out APC and they came closer and closer.
“No…”  
She turned. , Laina was deep in Railine literally with some area of him cut open once again.
Ryla stood up and knew what she had to do.  She had to keep them at bay, all while not fighting them to prove to herself the vow she made was not in vain.  That they could win without always resorting to violence like everything else rushed towards.
“Right here!”  She stood up, walking towards them slowly, her arms open by her sides.  She felt her Psionics humming strongly, she felt the neural chip in her braining calculating in levels she could not imagine, and lastly she felt - to use the Solarian term – the Ghosts of her warrior ancestors pulsing in her body.  She laughed.  “No one is watching, so I get to play with my full power!”



 
Madigan
Location: Sensor Anomaly

“Holy fuck…”  Aanother explosion detonated somewhere over to the left.  The entire placed was apparently rigged with some sort of explosives.  “We have to get out of here!”  Madigan yelled.
“No…way…”  Zaier was holding a shattered Renew Pak in his hand, part of it had been cut off.  Most kept their ReNew Paks in their coat pocket, which would be about where the large metal piece was stabbing through him.
“We can’t leave Zaier!”  Feyria saidcried, crouching at near him while he was face down in the snow, the large piece of metal sticking through his back.
“Fuck him!”  Madigan said,.  “He’d leave us!”  There was no doubt of that in his mind.
“Don’t…leave…me…please…” he gasped out from his face down position.
Far away where the other explosion had gone off there was an illumination that was making its way through the smoke.
“No…” Kalco said.
“Help me, Madigan!”  Feyria pleaded.  He pried his eyes very hard away from what he knew was coming out of that smoke over to Feyria who was trying to pull the metal out of Zaier.  
“Won’t he bleed out?”  Madigan asked.  “Let’s just carry him, we need to run.”
“No!” s She pleaded, tears falling off of his her face.  “I’ll use my ReNew on him, he won’t bleed out!”  She looked at him. , “Hhelp me!”
“Shit…”   Hhe walked over, squaring up to his body like he was getting ready to lift a heavy weight off the ground in a gym.
“Do…it …!”  Zaier muttered.
Madigan nodded at Feyria as they both grabbed a hold of the large piece that had quite literally pinned his body to the ground and with a grunt lifted it.  “Shit!  It’s slipping!”  Madigan yelled as it pivoted backd and smashed Zaier’s legs.
“Gahhh!”  
“Get it off!”  Feyria yelled.
“True Form!”  Kalco screamed, firing his pistol.
“I know!”  Madigan bent down and the two of them shoved it off his leg;, it was clear it had broken inwards from the crush.
Feyria knelt down, looking at Madigan.  “Fight that .  I know you can save all of us.”  She reached into her pocket and pulled out her ReNew Pak;, it had an orange cap which Madigan was pretty sure that was the wrong one.
“Why do I have an extra?  Why isn’t it the right one?”  She shook her head to clear the question and reared her hand back to stab it into Zaier.
“Wait!”  Madigan leaned forward to stop her.,  “That’s…”  Hher arm arched down, hitting Zaier as it injected straight into him.  “…for Birthers.”  He finished his words but they were useless.  He remembered where he had saw seen that orange;, it was Railine’s.  It might stop his bleeding, but probably put him into a coma at least short term.
“Madigan, get the fuck over here!”  Kalco yelled between pistol shots.
He pivoted around, un-slinging his energy rifle.  It took him a few moments to understand what he was looking at, though, as there was a black, dull metal stabbed through the barrel of his rifle.  Energy was leaking out of one of the severed conduits.  In the explosion something had hit his rifle, perhaps sparing him but certainly rendering the rifle useless.  “Holy shit…”
“There’s two!”  Kalco yelled, backing up, while still firing.  “Fuck…”
Madigan had fallen to his knees, thinking of Feyria’s words.  He was not going to be saving anyone.  Something suddenly knocked him in the side of the head.  He knitted his brows in confusion as he reached up, and was confused, feeling it with his hand.  FIt felt like a handle or something and he tugged at it .  It kept coming and the fight to his right faded away as he was lookinglooked at this the object that looked like a weapon with a long barrel.  
It was mostly silver and black but had a bright yellow band down both sides towards the tip of the opening.  Near the front it was curved upwards almost like two hooks.  Near the middle was three slashes of yellow similar to an exhaust port on other energy weapons but it appeared sealed.  It hummed with a silent, warm power.  
Light Lance recognizes you.
‘What the fuck was that?’ he thought to himself, hearing a voice somewhere, like on ICS.
This was Railine’s weapon he gave him.  Madigan had never been able to try it, but Railine claimed it worked.  He was now going to bet it all that it did.
He grasped the handle, and felt this a shock go through him as a confidence amid the despair they found themselves in filled him.  It was like an old weapon he had known forever.  His hands slid into position, his two fingers working a control of some kind near the trigger, his other hand bracing the weapon firmly.
Madigan was not going to die here.  This weapon would see to that.  He wanted to race Feyria still, and he had to save her to do that.
He was still kneeling but had faced the two True Forms.  T, the one of the left had frozen Kalco as he stood looking at the creature about to kill him.
Madigan was completely in the zone.  H, he had only felt this way very few times, when everything faded away and perfection was produced.  He would pull that trigger and something amazing would happen, or they all would die.
He pulled it, and there was were six bright green lights that came from somewhere outside the barrel and streaked inwards towards the tip, as if it was on a two-dimensional plane and they were gathering near the tip, like a miniature explosion in reverse, or that it was absorbing some sort of energy.
A small green laser-like thing shot out, and for a moment Madigan was happy it did something, but the power was useless.  It was like some weak laser rifle.  His thought only lasted for a moment.  T, the green line appeared to be some sort of anchor for the power as the very next instant in six directions down the length of where the green line had gone, red lines arched away, zigzagging between the center of the laser and an outer tube, forming almost a temporary scaffolding to a much larger ‘tunnel’ of energy.  This was followed by what was essentially a red/purple lightning bolt arching out of the gun, bouncing down the formed energy tunnel.
It instantly dissolved the True Form away as it exploded in a dazzling red snow and the lightning gun blew away a huge section of the cave in the distance.
“What the fuck…!?”  Kalco lowered his gun, turning to see what it was.
Madigan turned silently, pulling the trigger on the second True Form.  T, the entire scene of the small green gathering beam, the weak looking laser light, the red constructing tresses and the purple lightning bolt told lasted only a moment as the True Form was evaporated, another section of the ruins taken with it.
“Let’s go…”  A voice slapped him on the shoulder.  I, it was Zaier, up but staggering.  It was not a surprise he was alive, but he should not be moving.
“How…”  Madigan asked, his turn to be confused.
“Just go!”  Kalco yelled as the four of them ran out of the warm cave, up the exit to the waiting V-Plane.  By the end Zaier was running as good as the rest of them.  That was what a ReNew pak could do, but it was the wrong version, that was Railine’s .
“Gogogo!”  Kalco was first at the door, waving them all in.  H, he unhooked a set of grenades and tossed them down the hole of the tunnel, collapsing it on what was following them.  “Matter doesn’t stop them for long, take off!”
“Already on it!”  Feyria said from the cockpit.  T, the sudden jerk caused them all to catch their balance before the ships inertial comps activated.
Madigan slumped against the hatch, breathing hard.  “Holy…shit…”  Hhe was now aware of the weapon he had carried with him.  How the hell did Railine know?  From finding this at Reiko-7, hidden in the pile of bodies and furniture, and gave giving it to him.  Madigan did not think Railine ever actually fired it, but how could that have been.?
You saved us. – Feyria
Madigan once might have said something cocky, but had a respect for Feyria formed by everything they had gone through.  She was a damn good pilot, she didn’t leave Zaier behind, and actually somehow saved him.
I did it to save you. – Madigan.  The words came across calm and confident.
You…did? – Feyria.  He could tell she was bashful which was rare for her.
Of cours. e, I still need to beat you in that Lift Bike race. – Madigan
Heh…You’re on!  But…thank you.  To hear you say that…makes me feel good. – Feyria.
Somewhere a long time ago, the girls that had activated the pool cover as a horrible prank on Madigan and trapped him under the water and almost drowned him were a distant memory.  He would never give up an innate wariness of women, but…  Hhe smiled to himself, oddly content in a way he had never been.  P, perhaps not all women are like that .  Ironic a ‘playgirl’ like Feyria was the one he somehow found a bond with.
The faces of those girls that were jeering at him from above the dimaglass as he panicked rapidly, knocking at the glass while underwater was seared into his mind.  It was not the water he was scared from after, but the traitorous element he had found lurking in women’s hearts that had brought him so close to dying.  The educator that found him unconscious in the water only from the alarms of so much activity at night saved him, with the nanites keeping him alive far longer than the pre days where he would have been dead with no questions asked.  Would’ve been rRuled a strange suicide perhaps.
He didn’t ‘love’ her or anything ridiculous like that;, scars of the past were not so easily undone.  But, having a girl believe in him, and demonstrate a loyalty in such a dire situation left him with the logical conclusion it might be okay to actually spend some time with her.  He’d keep his defenses up, but…  Hhe laughed.  H…he had a race to win against someone he had every intention of smashing.  Ha, that was a good double entrendre.  Yeah, he’d smash.
“What was that?”  Zaier was standing above him.
“How are you alive?  Or, how did that ReNew pak work?”
“You first,” hHe said.
“I have no idea.  I, it was a weapon Railine gave me, he found it at Reiko-7.  I wish I could tell you more, but that was the first time I ever used it.  We are lucky it was so powerful.”
“Indeed.”  The white winter jacket’s they all had was stained red near Zaier’s stomach.  It was like someone had splashed an entire bottle of wine near his waist.  Many clothes had various recyclers which often included recycling blood, but with such a heavy focus on heat, blood recycling evidently was not implemented.
“That was a Birther’s…” Madigan began.
“Never use that term,.”  Zaier cut him off firmly.  “I was born through conception, and escaped a majority of Aelisha meddling one way or another.”
“What!?”  Madigan asked, his eyes were wide.  Zaier!?  Unrivaled intellect?  Cool, calm, collected?  Somehow was the base commander?  A Birther!?
“Your surprise demonstrates the typical prejudices against those of us non-AGEd.  Typical.  From my point of view, I look at you with your slave signs on your face and I am disgusted.  I maintain enough distance from the indoctrination I can still think for myself.”
“But…you have a Strive too.?”  Madigan stood up at this point, confused what was happening.
Zaier rubbed the mark on his left cheek,.  “Indeed.  I don’t take my slavery willingly.  My entire life has been to see the truth of how we are subservient to the Aelisha, see it first hand and then get out.  Do as much as I can, as fast as I can, all to accelerate my escape.”  He rubbed it more,.  “Once I am gone, it is coming off.”
“You excelled only to get out faster?”
“Is that unbelievable?”  Zaier asked.
“No,” Madigan shook his head.  “That makes a crazy amount  of sense,.  I just never came across anyone like that before.”
“There is a first time for everything.”  He turned, and went to sit down and look out the window, done talking.
There was no way anyone here could know what they were getting into, but for someone like Zaier who took on the hardest and most demanding assignments simply to lower his overall time serving in an empire he hated impressed Madigan was its foresight, in a very backwards manner that made sense to someone that could endure it.
Madigan went and sat down.  Kalco was two rows back and stared at him uneasily.  He had not said anything, which was odd for him.  He turned to look out the window when Zaier spoke to him again.
“Thanks for saving me.”
He turned to face the stone cold man.,  “I wanted to leave you at the time.”
“Actions speak louder than words.  You helped when it counted.  Because of you and Feyria I am alive.  That demonstrated a trust to me I had generally lost in others.”
“I think you might be reading into it,” Madigan said.
“No.  Not at all.  You risked at least part of yourself to save me.  I am not going to cry or hug you, but as man to man, I appreciate what you did.  I truly do.”
“Yeah…”  Madigan accepted it at that.  Maybe Madigan wasn’t as selfish as he thought he was.
Feyria’s voice came over the speakers, “Looks like we got some problems.  P, part of the reactor wall is destroyed, and looks like Ryla is down there.  Pulling around to the hangar.”  She sent a screen showing Ryla dodging inhumanely against two of the figures.  As they watched she had set it up nearly perfectly where they both slashed at each other, and her quick duck had the two of them hit each other, dropping the mutually severed bodies to the floor.
“Heh, looks like there might be a little more to Ryla than meets the eyes,” Zaier said, c.  Crossing his arms and smiling a dark smile.
“I think that everything that is going on here is more than meets the eye,” Kalco said in a cold tone that was deadly serious for the slightly sarcastic comment he copied.
Madigan looked back, and Kalco’s eyes  bored into his skull.  H, he turned back forward and gripped ‘Light Lance’ silently, wondering why he had thought to call it that.



 
Ryla
Location: Reiko-10, Fusion Reactor

Rox!  Rox! – Laina started yelling over the ICS.  
Ryla stood there silently, feeling a strange victory with the bodies on the floor she had not killed.
I’m here, only have to yell once. – Rox
Railine was nearly killed.  H, he is stabilized, but the APC was blown up by a bomb, we are stuck out here. – Laina 
Railine!?  Is he going to be okay? – Rox
Ryla jumped in, Rox, we need you to come get us.
The only vehicle here is the Lift Bike.  I, it looks like the other group is coming back with the V-Plane but… - Rox
It could not land  at the reactor, so it was useless.  The two women looked at each other and did have a smile though that somehow at least one person was alive from that group.  It felt like a late game save by someone they had long ago forgotten was around.
Look ,we just need to drag him back, can you rig something to the dogs?  Grab a vac bag  out of the medical storage and tie it to the dogs.  Y, you’re smart, come up with something.  We need Madigan out here fast, if he is still alive.  God, please still be alive…all of you. – Laina
Okay I’m on it, will take a bit.
Laina sighed, and went back to checking things on Railine.
Around Ryla were the corpses of the aliens that had attacked here.  Ryla had a very deep hang-up on violence.  It helped her act as ‘Ryla the girl’ be more sincere as it reflected her actual belief.  Her race had perpetuated an unbelievable amount of death and violence , not wantonly but as the highest level of self defense.  She knew others would never understand, and did not attempt to justify it.
To them, violence was regarded with extreme caution because of the high correlation to MalAxls, and while severely avoided it, were no strangers to it.  To Ryla, it was perhaps an inversion of sorts, given her warrior lineage, but wondered if there was not another way.
She was under no delusion that she had led to these things deaths, but was it really ‘her’?  She was not being cute in some sort of roundabout way, because it had large implications regarding Axls.  Regardless, surviving such a serious attack at such a vital time when she alone was responsible for protecting Laina and Railine was redeeming .
PShe had practiced what she preached.  Without violence, she had removed the enemy.  Their own violent tendency had been their undoing.  The irony was sweet to her;, she felt validated for her belief so many here had criticized.
Laina began talking.  S, she was kneeling at Railine but not looking at her.  “I was able to only watched some of that battle.  First, that was amazing, and I thank you so much.  I won’t say anything to anyone else, but you aren’t just a young woman are you?”  Ryla froze a bit, surprised Laina had picked it up.  “I was attached to a group once that had a Star Priestess, which they can fight unbelievably well by the way, but I now have the feeling you might already know.  Are you a Star Priestess?”
Ryla did not want to lie, but could never tell the truth.  “Kind of.  I have rReally strong innate Psionics.  That is all I can say.”
Laina looked up, smiling gently at the girl. , “You don’t need to say more.  Thank you.  I guess maybe you actually can sometimes win without fighting.”
“That’s what I needed to prove to myself.”
Outside they saw the bright lights of a Lift Bike flying in.  The room had become very cold due to a large part of the wall being blown away.  The excess heat of the reactor was losing being lost to the frigid planet.
The driver of the bike was quiet skilled and flew through the opening and landed on the clean floor.  The large pile of sterilization chemicals Ryla had set a while ago were long gone, and from what she could see even the next room was completely clean .
“Holy fuck…”  Madigan had hopped off the bike and saw his friend in a large pile of blood.  Laina was similarly covered like she was a butcher.  “Is he alive?”  Ryla could sense that  Madigan had a weird energy to him.
“For now.  I have him pretty stabilized, but I need way more time and materials.”
“Beta Wwing is destroyed,” Zaier, the other passenger on the Lift Bike, said.  “That won’t be an option.”
Ryla saw Laina clench her fist, and slowly let it go.
Ryla turned to Madigan. , “Aria is in there, the reactor is acting really weird.  It’s aAlmost melt down already.”  She would spare him the details of the intense battle against the crystal infection, the rush to stall it, the hit Railine took, the battle after…
“Damn it, I know exactly why too, fuck.  Of all the times to do it.”
“Stop,” Zaier said to Madigan.  “Excuse my ignorance, but are you able to stop whatever is leading to a meltdown, without shutting down the reactor?”
“Yeah, easy.”
“To clarify, what I mean, is, if we were to leave this alone, and it was attacked, would it start to do the same thing again?”
Madigan had a quick answer, “The same thing?  Probably not, but yeah, these things are potentially fragile.  I, if it starts getting attacked, it could melt down, blow up, or anything.”
“I want you to shut it down then.”
“What?”  Ryla asked.
“Why?”  Laina also didquestioned.
“We are leaving, and I don’t want this to be used against us.  Full explosions of these can damage an entire planet,” Zaier said.
“That is true,” Madigan began.  “But I just can’t ‘shut it down.’  I need to fix this first, then I could put it in a stasis of sorts, it would make the reactions—…”
“I don’t care about the details, would it blow up if sabotaged or attacked?”
“Not after what I can do.”
Zaier swept his hand away. , “Go do it, we are short on time.”
“But…no more heat.”
“Not an issue.”
Madigan shook his head, muttering, “Fuck,” and trottedbefore trotting away.  As he ran away it became obvious why Ryla felt something;, he had a CAO on his back.  It was shaped like a weapon.  Typical for the Solarians.
“Did you kill these?”  Zaier asked Laina.
“No.”
“Ryla?”   Hhe turned to face her.
“No, they killed themselves.”  It sounded coy but was true.
“What happened to you?”  Laina asked.  It perhaps was aA bit inappropriately ironic consideringas she was covered in far more blood than Zaier.
“Long story,.  I was pinned down by metal, and Feyria and Madigan saved me.  Not everyone is as selfish as I thought.”
Laina shook her head. , “Never understood why you ever thought that.”
“…Zaier.”  They turned to face Aria who had walked into the room.
In something that surprised Ryla, Aria’s face that always looked forlorn turned sad, as her eyebrows arched downwards, and her frown was covered by her hand.  Tears came rapidly to her as she ran over to Zaier.  He looked surprised as she hugged him, and he reluctantly reciprocated.
“What is going on?”
“You are still alive.  I am still alive too.,”  Her headshe was tilted downwards, and from her position Ryla could not see her, but knew she was crying.
“What are you talking about?  Of course we are alive.”
“I did not want to believe you were alive, but you were…you were.”
What is going on? – Ryla asked Laina.  She shrugged, and had gone back to doing something with gel on Railine again.
“You need to calm down,” Zaier tried to console.
“No, Valent, I remember you.  You kept my necklace, you wear it even now.  It is me, Suzene…”  She lifted her face and it was taut in emotional intensity.
His eyes went wide, and took a step back, but kept one arm on her.  “How…how!?”
“We both lived…I don’t know how, and to both cross paths again….”
“Why didn’t you say anything?”  His voice had an angry edge to it.
She lowered her head again.  I, it was so strange seeing this hard, cold sniper acting like this.  “I…wasn’t sure you would remember me…if I mattered the same way to you.”
“Why are you so stupid!?”  Zaier yelled.  Ryla was shocked herself, wondering if she needed to step int.  Aria pulled back, looking upset.  “Of course I never forgot about you, why do you think I kept this necklace?”
“You didn’t recognize me?” s She asked.
“On a level you felt familiar, but we both look different.  B, but…you died!  That’s why I never said anything.”
“I thought you did, too…”
“God…Aria…”  He stepped forward, grabbing her and pulling her in while they hung onto each other hardtightly.  “I knew, but I just was too scared to say something and look stupid.”
“Me too. , I was embarrassed and scared you wouldn’t like me.”
“I do…  Ggod…if we can just get out of this.”
There was some barking and Ryla turned to see Rox waving.  “Hurry up, we are under serious attack. , Kalco and Feyria are doing what they can.”  The dogs were leashed together.  Rox easily hopped over the obstacles, her face showing her surprise.  “Oh shit…Railine…!”  She knelt next to him.
Laina stayed a vigil over his body.  “Don’t worry, he will live for now.  You got something?”
“Here, just a nano block, but we could make a sled.,”  Sshe pulled out the ubiquitous block and tapped some controls on the holographic screen.  It changed into a thin, flat sheet of metal.
Ryla ran over and the three of them rolled Railine onto the metal, before they foldedfolding it up around him.
“The left side isn’t bad .,”  Tthe three of them picked him up and navigated the exploded wall over into the snow outside.
“It’s deep, but if the dogs go fast it shouldn’t sink.  The rest of us are going to have to run,”  Rox was speakingexplained while tying Railine to the three dogs.  She sat near the front of the folded metal.  “Come boys, go!”  On command they started running back to the base.  It was dark and snowy and was they were gone out of sight fast.
Ryla looked to Laina.,  “Do we follow her?”
“Yes.  There is nothing for us here.  You okay with running in this?”  Ryla nodded.  “We are heading back, hurry up!”  Laina yelled to Zaier and Aria, who were still crying and holding each other.
“The Lift Bike can hold three,”  Ryla told her.
“That’s what I planned on.,”  Laina grasped Ryla’s wrist.  “Let’s go.”  They shot off into the snow, their lights on their suit coming on as they followed the thin trail of the dog pack.
Outside, the cold bit into them strongly.  It would not take long for someone to die out here, even with their advanced suits.  The distance was not too far, but the heavy breaths out of both their mouths froze to their face.  By the time they had got to the ground vehicle bay, Ryla  she looked at Laina who had not pulled her hood either and their eyebrows were frozen, their nose tip frost bitten, and overall looked pale.
The door had been damaged and did not open but they crawled through a hole the Lift Bike must have gone out of.  As soon as they were inside, they heard a large fire fight.
“They need us,” Laina said, pulling her blade out.  The blood bath she had just been in painted her well for such an occasion.  In the main room Rox was staying low as she was dragging Railine’s body.  The dogs had been unhooked and were attacking some figure, tearing it apart.  Feyria was peeking over the bunker and firing with her pulse rifle and Kalco in his heavy armor was firing his pistol down the various hallways.
Laina dashed at the bunker, placed her right hand down, and vaulted it.  “I’m here, let me get any that come close, you guys focus on the far ones.”
From here, Ryla could see that Beta was destroyed, the hallway was collapsed.  She was hit with a hard wave:, she knew they were under serious attack.  There was were at least two MACs coming.  There was a large wave of the normal creatures flooding out of Alpha, and all three of them were occupied that direction.  They would be overran.  In such a circumstance Ryla could not just dodge-kill them either.  It was a special circumstance that allowed that.  If she did not act, they all might die.
“Over here!” s She yelled, gathering a few of them near here.  They came at her, but she was fast.  S, she dodged around until Feyria or Kalco had swung around and dropped them.  It was fitting in some way that Ryla was outside the bunker and was most useful there as a hard to catch bait.
She swayed, lured, and baited what she could, but in her mind she felt the True Forms –, as those around her called them – getting closer.
They were getting swarmed hard, the saving shot from Feyria or Kalco was much slower .  They were so often engaged with others threatening to breach the barrier where Laina swung her Nano-Blade separating their bodies.
There was a fast slash right in front of Ryla.  I, it caught her by surprise, as she was too caught up with all those behind her.  There was a limit to Psionic warning, even with the boost of the neural chip she had in her brain.  She backed up, and realized she was trapped, and the bunker was too tall right here to jump.  She would have to catch running  past the one in front of her…
The next instant a large shock wave separated its shoulders from its lower body.  “Ryla!”  She looked blinked in surprise, turning and seeingd and saw Aria who was waving.  Ryla wasted no time and blitzed the opening, jumping the barrier and dove diving to safety.
“Aria, why are you here?  Where are Zaier and Madigan?”
“Finishing.  There was something I had to do for a friend.”
“Holy shit….True Form!”  Kalco yelled.  Ryla’s heart dropped.  She knew the MAC was coming, but they were getting overran far too hard.  They had backed up from the inner wall already as some of them were getting over,; Laina could not fight them all.
They might die here.  There wasn’t really any hope anyway, but seeing the other group come back had temporally given hope that something could happen.  Now they would die ignobly inside the bunker, just like everyone at Reiko-7 had.
“Aria, do something!”  Feyria yelled, in-between slapping a new clip in.
Ryla was kneeling from crashing over the bunker, Aria was standing above her.  Aria, she turned, grabbed something, and held it out to Ryla.  “I was told you would know what to do with this.”  Ryla stood up.  A, all around her was chaos as at any moment someone cwould take a hit and from their the firing line would rapidly collapse.  “I don’t believe he was wrong.”
“A CAO…” Ryla said with wonder.  The handle was black, the rest of the heavy weapon was a bright silver.  Near the handle was what looked like a control or panel of some sort, but overall the appearance was that of a heavy machine gun.
TICKTICKTICK…  Bbehind her three of the MAC blades had missed someone, impaling the ground with an attack that could have killed any of them.  Aria looked at her silently, holding the weapon.  She had deep faith in whatever prophecy she heard.
Ryla hated violence for a reason that went beyond personal.  Too many had been forced into the Line because of things that might have been preventable.  She believed this.  She had lived it for so long, and the perhaps not so simple example of saving Railine and Laina by not attacking had demonstrated a concrete example that other’s violence could be their undoing.  She would never favor it, but after proving the contrary, she knew it could be done.
Now…she was ready to act.  She had proved to herself that violence was not the only way to solve problems.  Must like her race had, she was now ready to show that often sometimes violence did solve some problems.
She had felt the strong Emotion Field when she had first got here, and coming back it hit her again.  Some of the Solarian’s here might be perceiving whatever anomaly they were in.  This was not the first ‘time’ they had done something like this only because of all the death implanted into the EF.
She knew there was a greater than zero chance if she grabbed the CAO she would do irrevocable damage to herself.  Her race was partly resistant, but not enough for their power.  But…but…she came from a proud warrior line.  A lineage that fought with these very weapons!
She grabbed the weapon out of her Aria’s hand.  
‘ “Eternal Hope Everlasting”…I see.  I thank you for this.’ 
Down Alpha there were at least ten of the figures and Two True Forms.
Ryla might be an angel, but in this case it was one of death.  She calmly leveled Eternal Hope Everlasting right down the hall and silently pulled the trigger.
The sound first was a diminuendo of ‘Zuuuuu’ as it got quieter, but in the very next moment it was a loud, rapid ‘ZTZTZTZTZT’ of hundreds of small packets of energy grating the entire hallway.
Gauss Limiter Blocks on starships shot thousands of small teardrop rounds each moment.  T, they were not effective on shields, but when a shield was down it could often destroy a ship either through the incomputable depressurizations everywhere or a critical hit on a jump drive.  Ryla’s weapon was the equivalent of this, and it was like having a battleship in the room with them as it unloaded down Alpha.  The thousands that were launched in the short period of time literally grated everything in it.  The smaller creatures were unrecognizable before they could even hit the ground, their bodies torn apart again and again.  The True Forms flashed a quick ‘misting’ of the spiritual blood equivalent out their backside before exploding into the red MalAxl energy that faded out of visual spectrum.
“Holy fuck…” Kalco said in wonder.
“Ugh…” Ryla dropped to her knees.  She felt her own Axls wanting to separate, to rend her own existence apart.  She had bought them a major break…it would help but she could not fire again.  It took too much out of her, and she would die, of that she had no doubt.
“Thank you, ancestors,” she said silently to herself.  No one else would understand how special it was that Ryla could even fire it once, and secondly that she was not torn apart after doing so.  The thousands back then that likely ‘pulled the trigger’ again, knowing what would happen, only to buy their friends a better chance.  Yes, that was the selfless line she came from.
We are over at the hangar. – Zaier said on a command ICS override that would be ‘heard’ regardless of the chaos around them.
Get the hell outta there ! – Madigan yelled.
“Right.,”  Kalco looked back towards Alpha.  F, from here Ryla could not see, but she knew what was there: nothing.  “We’re falling back people, Aria, Feyria guard Gamma, I’ll take the other.”
“Rex, Rhett, Ricochet, come!”  Rox yelled.  “Come!”  She whistled, and when they broke away from standing off with something Kalco shot they dashed away with Rox out the door.
Aria lifted her rifle and started stepping away, firing.  But Ryla could not move.
“Ar…ia…” sShe barely managed to mutter.
She looked down, understood, and with one hand grabbed Ryla and drug her while holding her rifle in the other, firing occasionally.  She had drug her to the edge, and stopped.  “Kalco, help,.” s She said. , Kalco realized something was wrong with Aria .  He, shot a few times, jumped back over, scooped up the young girl over his shoulder, and clambered back.
Aria was the last one, and was about to jump when something had slashed at her.  It was from the side Kalco was covering but had stopped to get Ryla.  It was going to catch her solid, but a string of bullets hit it, dropping it.  Ryla turned her head to see Zaier standing at the door, firing hard at anything getting close.
No words were said, but Ryla suspected everyone had a respect for everyone else fighting here, including Zaier actually risking himself in this way.  Kalco bounded much like an animal through the snow, and threw Ryla into the V-Plane, turning and firing until the rest of them were on.  Zaier was the last, and from Ryla’s position of on the floor saw them nod at each other.  In Ryla’s grip she still held the weapon.  She was not sure she could let go if she wanted to.
“Gogogo!”  Kalco yelled.  A, almost instantly the V-Plane was airborne.  
“Rai…line…” Ryla muttered.  She didn’t think anyone got him.
“Oh fuck…”  Kalco looked shocked.  “Madigan, land, we have to get Railine!”
“Land the plane, we are going for him,” Zaier said.  E, everyone was surprised he actually ordered it.
The plane landed again.
Madigan popped out of the cockpit. , “Feyria, take control, I’m going to get Railine.”
“Me too ,” Laina said.
Kalco said nothing, banged on the door, and it opened.  Most of the crew spilled out.  The door was such that Ryla could see most of the way back to Reiko-10.  Madigan was second out, and he pulled his CAO out and it was like a lightning gun that blew apart the creatures in the way, detonating all the way to the Reiko-10 wall.  Aria hung back right outside the door but preferred this distance anyway as she sniped anything from the sides with Zaier next to her.
Kalco, Madigan, and Laina all ran out of sightde, only the occasional purple flash of the lightning gun, or the loud boom of Aria as any indication of what was happening.
Ryla had ceased being able to move.  A, at this point she was wondering if indeed a single shot was enough to kill her but slowly instead of at once.  She still could think clearly, though, so that was a good sign.  
Not much later Laina was running to the ship, carrying the metal sled behind her.  Zaier and Aria were outside providing covering fire as Kalco and Madigan were running back.  They all crashed inside, stepping on Ryla .
“Go!”  Madigan and Kalco both yelled, and the plane was airborne again.  It was high enough nothing could get them.
“Where do I go?”  Feyria asked.
“That alien ship, it’s our one chance,” Zaier answered.
“Holy…holy…” Kalco repeated a few times, trying to slow his breath down.
“We got everyone right ?”  Laina asked.  Ryla suspected she would go back if not.  “Eight…nine …and the dogs…okay everyone is here.  Ryla!”  She suddenly saw her, coming over.
Something is wrong with my… – Ryla almost said ‘Axls’ but Laina would not know what that meant.  I cCan’t move.  Can you drag me wherever we are going?  
I’d never leave you behind. – Laina.  She pulled out a Medi-kit, but of course it did not show much  with Ryla and was unlikely to do anything for her.  She just needed time for her Axls to restabilize.  She would live, and no short term ill effects.  Long term…well there was a lot less long term in her life now.  She smiled, but her face didn’t respond, but she was happy.  She would make that trade again,; it had saved everyone.  It bought them critical time, and killed the two MACs that easily could have killed them all.
The flight was not that long given how fast she was flying.  There was a lot of talking, a lot of checking to make sure no one was injured and other than physical damage such as to Zaier, no one had been hit by the creatures other than Railine.  For how close of a call it was at all stages, and the other group likely had having a similar situation, no one being hit was easily a thousand to one.
“Hey…uh…”  Feyria’s voice showed hesitation.  “This alien ship looks like it melted out of the ice, and…the gyro copter is there.”
“The gyro-copter!?  That’s right I was distracted when I first noticed it…” Zaier said something to himself.
The plane had landed, and the door opened.  At this point it was dawn, the light of the sun was coming up, the snow had stopped, and the entire landscape was a white brilliant display.  Laina had hoisted Ryla up and with had Kalco on the other side were supportinghelping to support her.
Next to them was the Gyro-copter and the door opened.  A, a figure came out in power armor , having a shotgun and a CAO strapped to his back.  He did not have a helmet on, and his spiky hair spoke to his rebellious nature.  He walked towards them with both his palms facing them and open.
“About time you guys got here.,”  Solide had a deep grin on his face.  “Hard to believe that bastard Railine hid the fact the copter being gone just by making a big deal about a single figure in the distance and saying I wandered off to die.,”  He laughed hard to himself,.  “Ahhh, iIf only you guys had any clue of what went on behind the scenes."


 
Railine
Location: Arc Landale Mountain Range – Laniina Prime

The cool air of Lania Prime blew softly over the valley below him.  The green of the trees and the purple/blue of the mountains rising around him were a visual treat that was completely lacking in the colorless world of Reiko.  He had seen enough gray of metal, white of snow, and red of blood to last him many life times.  From here he could see the string of high alpine lakes, and further away a small cloud of mist where the river spilled over the rocks at a decent height he used to jump from as a kid.
The elevation here was much higher than he was used to, and with the different atmosphere concentration from Reiko he paused to laugh at himself with the simplicity of being out of breath from the long hard march he took up here.  He laughed hard at the ridiculousness of the normalcy of what was happening to him.  He was likely one of the best fighters in terms of True Forms currently alive, and here he was holding his knees and gasping for air in the high mountains.  Nanites worked fast, and the mechanical heart valves he had pumped blood at a higher volume, allowing him to recover and he recovered fast.
He rounded the corner, coming to where he remembered it occurring and was disappointed he didn’t feel more of anything thereat it.  Turning his head to confirm the location, he looked around a bit, trying to recall the young memory.  Perhaps it was a memory that chronologically would not be that hard to recall, but supplemented by thousands of times him and his friends were splattered across a lifeless planet made it distant.
It had changed some, bushes had grown up, and looks it looked like another landslide at some time in the passed past had occurred.  It was the right place, given the junction of the valleys he was in, and the narrow passage the trail took.  Further ahead the trail was wiped out from some later slide, but it didn’t really matter.  He stood there, with his eyes closed, trying to remember the young Railine and his girl  friend right here so long ago.  
The final loop had occurred somewhere in the 18,000s, if not higher given the constant loss of minor loops.  Using the Terra scale as a guideline, and assuming each loop lasted only two cycles on average, which with many lasting what seemed like endless night after endless night, it still put him at over one hundred revolutions of Terra around the Sol star.  In some ways it was like he was an old man, trying to recall a youth long since passedpast.
He sat down, sad at the realization that some part of his life was gone in the haze of the ‘past’.  It was somewhere right near here.  H, he remembered hanging onto this rock to look downwards before they set off and he was nearly killed in the landslide.  This was his favorite trail until that day.
He had a few rocks in his hand, thoughtlessly rolling them around and eventually tossing them off the edge, hoping for inspiration to come to him.  Why exactly had he come here?  What was he hoping to find?
Even the events of Reiko had occurred almost an entire revolution of Lania Prime ago, which was only slightly shorter than Terra.  Of course everyone promised they would keep in touch and all that, but Railine knew life had a way of driving people apart.  Besides, most of them never knew what actually occurred there – on multiple levels of the upper dimensional actors, Railine and Solide’s extreme backdoor planning, or any of the truth the two of them knew about all the others.
Things like Kalco being an Aelisha agent, Ryla being some sort of advanced Alien the Solarian’s had not have contact with yet, Laina and Zaier both being potential True Forms, all were unknown.  From someone like Kalco’s point of view, his secret was safe, and the event was only a few Reiko cycles long, not the suicide inducing nightmare he lived through.
The thought made his sides itch badly.  He lifted his shirt, seeing if anything was abnormal, but just saw the large pink scar that Laina told him he would have his whole life due to the nearly deadly hit he took.  Something about the proximity to the N-Limit, and actually surviving and a new steady state - this was all explained to him but it didn’t really matter.  He was scarred and burned as a kid so he never had any realistic hope of perfect skin.  It was just another scar on his body.  The itching was a mild annoyance though.
All nine of them were his friends, but only a few of them knew the truth.  To almost all of them, the events at Reiko-10 represented a straight linear occurrence.  The looping never consciously happened, and it was a few trying days to them, but nothing like the nightmare endured by the few others.
A wet nose started nudging him in the face;, it was very needy for some loving.  He turned and pet the large dog.,  “Huh boy?  That was just a few days  for you, wasn’t it Rhett?”  He pet the dog he had kept.  Rox, given the persona she portrayed, put up a fight but only kept Ricochet for herself, and Kalco and /Laina took Rex.  “Though, you can’t talk.  M, maybe I am being mean to you.  Y, you might have remembered all of it, maybe you remember more than I do.”  He ruffled the dog’s ears a bit, and gave him a light smack on the side.  “Go find a stick or something.”  The dog bounded  away back down the trail.
In the end, Kalco and Ryla seemed to understand something was happening on some level, perhaps something to do with the heavily loaded Emotion Field that had been pounded in by ten thousand deaths.  The only two that got it for sure was Rox and Solide, of which the former could not really be spoken for in any terrestrial capacity.  Only one other person could understand the life span of horror that endlessly played for them.
Railine had a hard time with tight quarters, and in general being around people.  He did not have a trust problem exactly, but given what occurred at Reiko-10, and the potential that anyone at anytime could be a True Form around him left him with a dull anxiety.  
Solide had been oddly fortunate that Rox had been his partner or whatever exactly the correct term for it was.  He liked to pretend he was cold and dead inside but saw how much he slowly opened up with her, and even Railine in the end.
Further, maybe the endless debauchery Solide and Rox engaged in was to some purpose as Solide seemed calm and bemused at the end.  Railine had a confidence born of endless deaths, but it came at a high cost of that any sound would instantly put him into battle mode.  It was easily over half the time he had would  woke wake up each time from a nightmare, thinking he was still on Reiko-10.  Only turning the lights on, finding himself in a normal room, in normal clothes, with Rhett licking his face told him he was not there.
Rox served an oddly subtle but important role and that was keeping her charge mentally stable.  Railine considered himself one of the most mentally tough people he knew, and was unhinged multiple times during Reiko, simply because of the hopelessness of the situation.  For Solide, Rox was a friend, an intimate lover, someone to understand the pain; all of which Railine did not have.  It was one death after another with no way out.  It left him with scars deeper than he might realize.
It got so bad he had to start taking low level suppressors on mental activity before going to sleep.  He utterly hated drugs, but was falling apart without any sleep.  He had doubled down on his mediation practice, and liked to think it had helped.  B, but what had happened there was not the end of the story, but merely only the beginning, and that had stressed him.
He understood the hate and distrust Solide came into the Reiko story with, because Railine now ended with it.  He saw first hand the ‘modality’ Solide and Kalco occasionally referenced of that anyone around him could be a lurking True Form.
As a single man, he could rack up True Form kills that would put elite Aelisha squads to shame.  That did not include being armed with his Axl artifact, the Ice Rose.  Madigan had a cool lightning gun, Solide had some super solid-state shotgun, and all he got was a flower.  He smiled at the subtle joke.  H, he liked it, it was appropriate.  The healing power it radiated had saved his life with the gambit he took at the fusion reactor.
Being cut in three pieces would be instant death, even nanities likely included, but the heart valves and the artifact given back to him by Aria had worked.  The valves only needed to keep his core alive long enough for both Laina, and the Ice Rose to bring him back to essentially normal further down the road.
Here he was, an elite among elite for fighting a dimensional creature, plagued by nightmares and itchy scars.  He tried to minimize contact with other people also, both for the fear of them, and the oddity of knowing ‘nothing’ about them left another type of anxiety he had to deal with in his post lifetime of combat.
It was fFunny in a sad way.  I, in a straight fight there was likely no one that could take him, a true ‘super soldier’ yet here he was talking about stress and nightmares.  I, it was only likely those that had gone through their own endless nightmares might understand the duality.  Understand being brought low by their own mind.
He took a huge breath in of the clean mountain air, the air he had grown up breathing as a kid.  He kept his eyes closed, trying to remember things of his past, and but they were just so distant,; almost dream like.  The brain could only handle so many memories, and with fighting and /death being pretty scarring almost everything of his childhood was gone.  Only very vague sensations of going through towns he knew he grew up at brought anything; and usually that was just ‘I should know this place, but hardly anything sticks out.’
He felt like crying due to, the strange burden he was forced to carry.  Living a lifetime in an endless combat zone of his friends killing each other, he was surprised he was not more messed up.  Maybe that was part of his problem.  L, look at the two who got it: himself, who might have some distorted capacity to feel due to childhood trauma and endless meditation to get over it, and an ex-killer who freely admitted he was probably ‘fucked up’ in his own words.
“Was that why we were picked, because we were messed up?” h He asked the mountains.  They gave no answer.
Rhett had come back, dropping the stick behind him, and gave giving a bark to show he was there .  Railine turned, grabbed it, and threw it back towards the safer area of the trail,; the dog ran playfully after it.
That answer didn’t seem right.  Railine had feelings.  Even by the end Solide did as well.  H, he proved self-sacrificing and perhaps woke a hero in his soul he had long forgotten existed.
Pulling out a water bottle, he caught a glimpse of his reflection with his neon white hair.  ‘Marked’ as some may call it.  Solide would be the same way now, given his close proximity to Rox, and his Axl artifact, the shotgun ‘Hrunting’, as he said it was called.  Railine’s came from a very small due exposure to Rox, but mostly from the Ice Rose.
Reiko was so loaded with Axl artifacts that everyone there would likely be showing telltale signs of Marking sooner rather than later.  He hoped they weren’t hunted down by the True Forms as he had heard rumors about Marked people being mysteriously killed.  He was worried about the others; at least, with his skills he was safe.
It was purely his own theory, but it appeared being in proximity to the artifacts eventually caused ‘Marking’, and this might be a type of higher resonance that was being achieved.  It was evident someone without any natural inclination of spirituality, awareness, or even the right Axl frequency could eventually use one, as what happened with Madigan, given his gun by Railine thousands upon thousands of time.  Therefore, most of the people who survived Reiko-10 would now be at a higher Axl frequency, which would explain why maybe the True Forms could find and hunt Marked people down.
There was no doubt it was the Ice Rose, the advanced heart valve transplant he purposely took before, and Laina’s skill that kept him alive from an attack he should have died from.  The MalAxl dose he likely got from that True Form attack shortened his life one way or another.  He wasn’t sure if it simply knocked time off, or that it merely built up until some point when he would just instantly die if he came across more MalAxls.  That was scary, and as a result he tried to live more fully because one way or another it would be over faster.
Something had happened that his Axls had started vibrating or harmonizing – he didn’t know the true name of such things – which was physically shown by his white hair.  It had the advantage that his health, strength and mental abilities were all improved but at the cost of a shorter life – this was in exclusion of the MalAxl dose.
In retrospect, that meant that in addition to Solide and himself, two others were likely ‘Marked’ with their neon white hair and elevated biologic abilities, and that was Ryla and Madigan that each used a Line weapon.  Madigan being Solarian might show less life lost than Ryla who literally was floored using it only one time.
Her being an alien, Railine was not sure if her hair would be white, but for all intents she would have whatever effect the rest of them had but to a larger degree.  Did Ryla know the sacrifice firing that weapon would do?  It saved everyone, that was for sure.  It was also after Aria and Madigan had done their work on the reactor, meaning it was entirely likely the loop might have ended, and anyone dying then was dead ‘for real’.
The dying part was something that bothered Railine for only a short while.  When he first came back, he was paralyzed that he knew nothing about the coming day.  A single reckless Lift Bike crash or someone shooting and he was gone forever.  Eventually he came to grips with that he had lived an entire extra life already and there was a beauty in not knowing the subtle outcomes in existence.
He stood up with another sigh, walking over to where it was approximately that he almost died a lifetime ago.  Maybe he was hoping she would somehow be here, or that it would trigger some awakening of something.  Maybe his LineGod would be sitting here laughing, making a joke about how hard his path was.  
Maybe it would be a latent Psionic he would magically get coming back here?
Nothing.
Just the wind blowing passed him.  Thousands of rocks below him, one of which had his name on it which did not claim its prize that day.  The longer he stood here, the dumber he felt.  E, everyone everywhere had spots they almost died, why did he think anything would be different here?  The mere thought that his girl female friend had Psionic powers of course was a major motivator and gave him fuel for trying to figure out what was occurring.
‘I don’t know.  Just trying to tie up loose ends I guess,.’ h He thought to himself.
There were loose ends of course.  But real life wasn’t like a holo.  T, the good guys didn’t always win, or not everything was explained.  Perhaps they had ‘won’ here, but victory was in the eyes of the beholder.  Zaier and Laina’s latent spiritual/Axl leanings of course would view it as a loss.  They might even ‘awaken’ themselves later at some point with the right catalyst.  Feyria was sympathetic to the True Form ideology when it was espoused to her by Zaier in certain loops.
Was it a victory that Zaier and Aria ended up together?  On the surface of course it was happy and perfect.  But it didn’t take much reading between the lines.  Aria had died at some point in her past and some elite Solarian or likely alien intelligence resurrected her enough in an android/Solarian hybrid body because as a pure Solarian her Axl affinity was likely higher than either Solide or Railine’s.  Her death left many of her memories shattered, but enough apparently there was still desire between her and Zaier.
That left Railine out of the love triangle, and here he was tossing stones off a cliff, being melancholic about some place he almost died at as a kid.
He liked Aria of course, but at this point, he was not sure he could have a normal relationship with anyone ever again.  Certainly not any female from Reiko;, he knew too much about all of them and unlike Solide, they did not ‘live’ the loops;, short of whatever Ryla was and whatever level she perceived it at.
That was another thing not like the holos, he was not going to be happily ever after with any of the females.  Definitively, he could say completely knowing someone was not a good thing.  People have far too many foibles, shadows, and darkness in their hearts they suppress and its better to never see that side of them.
Still, the existence of Aria among others suggested there were Fate Lines at play here far beyond just what happened at Ten10.  Someone, somewhere saw the Axl Affinity that the dead or dying Sniper girl Aria/Suzene possessed and thought it was worth it to bring her back, albeit at a reduced capacity.  ‘Reduced’ such that she was still on par with the likes of the two males.  That of course, left another loose end, that on the surface, her and Zaier looked complete, but he was on the entirely different side than Aria, when their Axl harmonics were factored in.  That couldn’t be a story that was Fated to end well.  Or even if it did, it meant that Zaier never found his soul’s ‘true purpose’ if Railine could call it that.
Grabbing a big rock, he pitched it far off the side.  Rhett barked after it, but was smart enough to not jump off the steep edge.  Railine turned and started to walk away.  He admitted perhaps a more selfish reason, he hoped that maybe that girl meant something more important to him and would be appearing in his ‘Line’ sometime soon here.  Maybe even a LineGod.  It was vain to think, but not completely unlikely.  Mentally he was a bit shattered.  W, why had the universe not deemed him worthy of being healed or partnered?
Rox was very vague about such things, because she would say how such knowledge would aeffect the Fate Line, but acted freely when it was only the Chrono Line she was messing with that was about to end.  He had gathered enough that she acted as a modulator for Solide’s psyche among other things.  Quiteet clearly as a metaphor she was almost the ‘thought’ and he was the action, so there was a level of manipulation occurring that neither was likely to admit.
Her wild antics hid an intellect that only later seemed obvious.  Railine would wonder why she couldn’t tell him something when he was about to die.  The answer now, was that the loop was over, and if she had indeed told him some grand secret of the universe he could presumably remember it past the loop and would now be in possession of it.
Saying it that way seemed partially wrong.  From what he understood it was not like she held some secret that would spell the end of existence, more so just that any knowledge she gave him that he did not have himself could have Fate implications, of which LineGods literally could not affect.
The interesting thing, was that he now understood the differencet between the Fate and Chrono Lines, of which she would use mention and he thought were the same.  I, in a way they loosely were, with but had a big difference.  It was all rather impressive too, given he possessed zero Chrono Psionics
Rhett kept running into his legs, open to the air with his pair of shorts, with the slobbery stick.  He laughed, grabbing it, and launchinged it into the bushes ahead of him.
Explained simply, there were a thousand Chrono Lines occurring at Reiko-10, of which only one Fate existed.  Of the Chrono Lines, which all had their individual Junctions, ‘Ddoes Solide kKill Rox?’ ‘Is Zaier infected?’ ‘Does Madigan Survive?’ each of which caused tons of ripple effects ‘down the Line’, all branching off and sometimes re-weaving.  ABecause any different answer to any of those questions, changes further outcomes:  Solide might not kill Rox, and that changes what occurs even if both Zaier gets infected and Madigan does not survive.  It was somewhat like the roots of a tree:, a million different branches, some that weave back in, many just ending.  Death for those on that Line.
A thousand Chrono Lines didn’t make a Fate Line, but that might be the way to describe it.  Perhaps a Fate Line could be described as a generality of a collection of Chrono Lines.  Again, that was purely general, because as Railine understood it, a Fate could be achieved on a single, solitary Chrono Line.
Diverging Chrono Lines lead to different Fates in most circumstances, but certain Chronos might lead back to a similar end.  Such as perhaps Railine had a Fate to end up at Reiko, and he did it this way through being Damage Control, but he could have taken a different path, as a different role, and still ended up there.  This was not to say in all circumstances did he end up there, just that different paths could lead to a ‘same’ end.
The only Fate on Reiko at the time, was that the loop had to end.  To complicate things somewhat, while everyone did indeed live, Railine was not exactly sure that was what was required.  So, to elucidate somewhat, say perhaps that the Fate was merely that ‘Reiko is not destroyed, some people escape’.  There are a lot of Chrono Lines that lead to that end.  Perhaps Railine did not need to almost kill himself so Laina could save him.  Or, to take the example, say Madigan did not actually need to survive, or that Zaier could have been infected and killed and the Fate is still accomplished.
In any of these Chrono Lines leaving they have vastly different potential outcomes.  If he didn’t sacrifice himself, maybe Laina never goes on to be a famous medical researcher, or that maybe he doesn’t become melancholic and takes Madigan up on being the lead damage control on Madigan’s ship, maybe even saving his life one day.  Take a different one line that Madigan doesn’t live  on Reiko normally, but now Madigan keeps rising up the ranks and becomes some elite fleet officer.  H, him being alive now has the potential for a different Fate, say he leadsperhaps leading a brilliant defense of some Solarian planet against the Burn.  That entire collection of potential Chrono Lines is definitely a different ‘Fate’ than say Zaier coming back into contact with MalAxls and eventually killing and turning a whole planet.
Railine laughed.  H, here he was speculating on things not even beings like Rox probably knew.  The examples he gave were of course different Fates, but it was entirely likely it might all end the same anyway.  That if Zaier re-awoke, maybe Fleet Commander Madigan is the one who razes the whole planet and restores a similar set of Chrono Lines as if neither of them had lived, minus of course all the Chrono Lines anyone on that planet might have had.
“Come on boy, let’s get out of here.”
He turned back once more to the location where he felt like something might have happened, or triggered.  But nothing.  No Psionic power, no LineGod, not girlfriend.  Just an old memory.
“You really are just dead, aren’t you?” he whispered, but no one answered .
							***
He knew she was buried here, but wanted to go the mountains first, perhaps hoping after all the craziness he had gone through, just maybe there might be some happiness for him.  Strange to start desiring a girl he had gotten over, and in perception of time was at least a lifetime away.  Certainly there was a lot of obsession that had manifested, due to him seizing on that she was the nearest thing he could think of when he started physically living the Chrono Lines as he was reset to the beginning over and over.
He had left Rhett tied up back at the Lift Bike a respectful distance away from the graves.  There was a small kiosk at the large stone archway.  The panel turned on as the light blue holographic screen opened in front of him.  He pulled up the information panel at the entrance of the graveyard and found the location before he set off.  It wasn’t far from his sister’s.
Graves were pretty rare in Affiliated space, but for the most part planets were allowed to keep their own culture, even if it was as ‘abhorrent’ as live births and burying their dead.  Some graves were big, a few sets of flowers, or rocks left on various graves.  Her’s was near a big tree, getting and as he got closer he started crying.  It was all pretty ridiculous really.  I, it was a girl he liked at the time;, they had parted amicably and that was that.  Only through the horrors of the Reiko loop and his fascination with her precocious Psionics hade she started occupying a larger part of his mind.
Her grave was small, the corners getting covered by grass.  Looking over a row, he recognized his sister’s grave as well.  Hoping something might happen here, it finally hit him nothing was going to happen.  He was wrong, and he was left out in the cold.  Alone and shattered .
The universe had provided what seemed like a custom therapist to Solide, maybe under that guise all while using him, but he left Reiko with the mental problems Railine had.  The universe gave Railine nothing.  H, he was just used as well, but did not get any compensation.  He was but one small lifeform, in the grand scheme completely meaningless; but from his own point of view, he mattered.  To see his meaningless so starkly hurt.  He had hung onto a hope, that everything he went through was for something.
Had his friend  of his sister died for something?  No.
He fell to his knees and started sobbing.
Everything happened for a reason, he truly believed that.  Yet here he was crying in the grass at a graveyard in the woods.  He had served such a vital role of stopping that time fracture, been so spiritually devote, aware of the subtleties around him…and to what?  Be discarded?  Was the universe this cold and uncaring!?  Why did Solide have Rox!?  He gripped his fists hard tightly into the grass, his mind was running away from him again.
He had known his friend was dead when he came back to Laina Prime, and even felt sad when he first found out.  But seeing the simple grave with her young age she died at hit him hard.  She had died not long after he left;, they were both pretty young still.  His sister had died not much younger, in the fire he blamed his parents for abandoning her in.  
All the weight of everything he had lived through on Reiko, a literal life of torture, and here this young friend of his was an odd inspiration to keep going mixed with some vague promise he had towards his sister.  Somewhere along the line the two of them loosely blurred together.
The wonder of his friend’s Psionics gave him hope and an investigative lead to follow amidst his deaths, along with ; and his sister dying and remembering how strong of a promise he had made to himself.  So many times upon each new loop he realized the irony that he could die and re-live, whereas his sister was gone forever.
The His sister was never coming back, and that was a drive to keep him going that her death was permanent, and he could never give into hedonism or nihilism and had to make it out, if her sacrifice and his drive were to be for anything.  The friend, he had no idea she had died relatively young, and seized upon her as some sort of hope for the future that, perhaps someone, anyone that could understand even a part of what he had gone through.
Without the two of them he would have broken down so long ago.  He didn’t have a Rox to comfort him.  H, he was alone, driven by a promise to a dead sister and a hope to meet a girl he hoped was still alive.  So stupid now.  Both of them were long gone, b.  Buried under the ground here that he was clutching with his closed hands and streaming eyes.
He cried and cried, Rhett in the distance barking because he knew something was wrong with Railine.
How could he explain what he had gone through?  What his hopes and past promises were based on?  The reality of these dead young women hitting him hard after 18,000 loops of just wanting to get out kept his emotions spilling out.
‘It doesn’t make sense. , Solide had the LineGod Rox, where was Aria’s?  Where was mine?  Why weren’t you mine?’ h He thought to himself, and almost as fast, a wave of self-hate came over him.  ‘Why do I think I deserve anything close to that?  I’m just an idiot, greedy and vain.’ A softer side of his mind answered, ‘I only wanted someone that could understand.  Someone tThat might get it.  A friend…’
“I just wanted a friend!  Anyone who could possibley understand…” he yelled before his words turned pitiful, his face was in his hands, his eyes burning from far too many tears.
Why should he get anything?  Did his sister get anything when she was burnt alive?  Did his friend get anything when she was killed by a vehicle, bleeding out while pinned to a building?
“Because Solide…Because Rox…” he muttered, whimpering over the crushing trauma of everything he sustained at Reiko was rearing its memories again.
In the distance an older couple paused, looking at him, and kept their distance.  Seeing them just made him cry harder, no one knew.  No one knew.  He was utterly alone.
“Why weren’t you mine?”  He cried, laying down his tearful face on the cheap grave where a corner had begun slowly chipping off, weathered by time.
